Marcus H,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","It was very comfortable in my hand. The battery life is decent, and you can still use it while it’s plugged in which is nice. The added customizable weights are cool, but a little beyond my needs so I have not used them. Having the G-tech app to support the features is pretty cool. You can update settings and also build presets depending on what game/program you’re using. It feels very well constructed in your hand, not cheap at all. You definitely get what you pay for!"
Tom M. Haddox,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2021","This thing is simply the best mouse for an affordable price, that money can buy. You can usually get this guy for $50 when its on sale, and boy is that a deal. The G502 HERO has the fancy-dancy HERO sensor, which is, I think, the best sensor that they sell. The mouse is very ergonomic, though it took me some getting used to. If you download the logitech software, you can customize each and every button to do different things, it has virtually revolutionized my browsing experience by binding ""next tab"" and ""previous tab"" to two separate buttons. It has good DPI control, and you can even modify the weights in the bottom of the mouse to bring the center of gravity further back or further up on the mouse! HOW COOL IS THAT?

Only downside, is that after 14 months of constant use, the rightclick button no-longer holds down properly. But for $50, I cannot complain. Though, I would recommend buying the 4 year warranty."
Chris McGuinn,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020","I finally had to bite the bullet and buy a new mouse after my old wired Logitech gaming mouse died after over a decade. Probably a good/combined 8hrs/day over that 10 years it was used for work and gaming (lets see how this one holds up ;P). The ergonomics of this mouse are far superior to my old one. I could never ""naturally"" reach the extra/furthest thumb button on my old one which made it only useful for working, terrible for gaming.

Yet on this mouse, every one of the thumb buttons are placed naturally. Well, TBH, 4 of the 5 are. The 5th (the solo one between the upper and lower pairs) is a little bit of a stretch for my thumb, but doesn't compare to the stretch on my old mouse. Might also have to do with how I hold the mouse. I normally/naturally don't ""cup"" it around my whole hand. I usually ""claw"" it and hover over it reducing the hand span.

The customization via the program is amazing and extremely versatile. I've already programmed specific buttons for various different profiles including Sketchup, AEC Collection software, 3D renderers, etc. Also, the ability to customize the overall weight is GREAT. Initially, I never thought this would be something I'd toy with but for work, I love having all of the weights in as well as loving the ""toggle"" between clicks/steps on the scroll wheel and changing it on the fly to ""free-wheeling"" and smooth. Yes... That's a feature, it's not ""broken""...

I primarily bought this for my home PC but loved it so much, I just bought another one for my office PC. Coupling this with my 3D Connexion SpaceMouse at the office for modeling has been nothing but great."
Tommy,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024","I got this a long time ago and still use the mouse, has a website to set up the mouse weights inside of it that you can adjust and the option to unlock and lock the roller from free spin to a mechanical type feel roll that I think is really cool along with the logo glowing"
Andrew,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2023",I've been using the G502 mouse for a few years now on all my computer builds. I recently built a white PC and wanted to get this mouse. It looks super nice in person and it performs just as well as the other G502s that ive had in the past that ive been using for years. I have no doubt this thing will still be in perfect working condition in years to come!
Angel Reyes,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021",I use this mouse on a daily it's for for every game I won't lie it's clicks are very gud and light the mouse is fast and it's butterfly clicks are pretty high downside is it dosnt double click witch is fine
Egor,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2022","Great mouse. Solid build quality, nothing creaks. Had one issue where the right switch would get slightly stuck for a brief moment when pressing and holding it for a time and releasing (like aiming down the sights), especially when the room was cold. The mouse was replaced by Amazon and since then I have had no issues, including the dreaded double-click. However, I probably use the mouse less than some, so maybe mine hasn't worn-out as much to have issues. Hopefully will never have.
Another small thing to note is the weight - this mouse is on the heavy side even without the added weights. For each their own though. I'm fine with the weight."
John Loftin,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2023","I can see how the free wheel could be annoying for some, but I absolutely love it! Great mouse over all! had to watch a youtube video to figure out how to take the bottom off to install weights (no tools, you just need to find the magic spot to pull on). I've been a logitech customer for years... don't plan on switching any time soon."
John Schimminger,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021","I have normal to larger sized hands and this mouse fits my grip perfectly. I am not a fan of the claw grip, palming is more my style and this fits it perfectly. It's probably a little too big if you prefer a claw grip on your mouse.
I also love that the weight is adjustable because unlike the majority of gamers, I like a hefty, heavy mouse. I put all the weights in except for one and it is perfect. If this thing wears out or breaks I will buy another immediately. I have used many mice from many manufacturers and this is far and away the best for me for FPS."
Cheryl your Succulent Designer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","I gave this product to my grandson for his birthday and he said he loves it! That's basically what matters to me but otherwise he says it's fast and his hand doesn't get so tired when he's playing long bouts at his game console. I try to get them outside more and have designated time after homework to play games. School, I tell him is his most important job. At this time in his life anyways. Right now his most important job to him is winning!"
anon,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023","Fairly expensive but mostly worth the price, very comfortable and accurate tracking. No double-click issues either"
Christian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2021","When my Corsair M65 broke down, i ran to this mouse for refuge. And it did not disappoint. It’s plastic, can feel a bit flimsy but put those weights on and you’ll never even notice it. The mouse wheel is so0o0 satisfying to let spin endlessly, just the right amount of buttons too. Only grime is the rgb is a bit minimal, so if you’re not looking to impress a reddit thread and looking to pump that K/D ratio up with some sick mouse flicks then look no further gamers"
KEITH,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021","Ive had like 4 of these mice. Only issue I ever have is that over time, the left mouse button seems to either lose sensitivity, to where I have to click harder or it unclicks when I dont intend on it. So when it gets to this point, I know to replace the mouse and I pretty much just order 2 at a time and have one on back up. I love the mouse though. So I dont bother going with anything else."
Greg Torosian,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022","Best gaming mouse. I've tried a dozen mice, but nothing comes close. The dpi switch buttons can accidentally be hit sometimes. that is only con"
BSpat,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2021","Was looking for a wired mouse to use with my desktop. I've used Logitech mice for years so I wasn't worried about trying a new company's product. Lite gamer and heavy productivity user - this mouse is perfect for both. I really liked the ability to add weights to it. Love the coloring and size. Overall, very pleased and would highly recommend."
FrankyJB,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021","This is my 3rd Logitech G502 Hero Mouse, each one my side buttons that i use often for Fortnite and Siege decide to Double click on me. Its annoying, but im willing to pay for new One’s cause of how amazing this mouse is for me personally. If there made to break like this, ya’l better chill your making Millions like just stop it or something."
Joy Duran,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020","I purchased this to replace my other mouse that up and died on me while in the middle of a game. Its sensitivity is great and the scroll button is awesome. It moves smoothly across the mouse pad as well. It is a bit on the heavy side though, so beware. It also Lights up! so that's a plus! All in all a great product. Thank you!"
Steve Baccari,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",My friend recommended this mouse and I’ve tried it before! Fits in the hands perfectly and the weight is adjustable. I love the white colors in this one! Sharp and clean. Great price. Great product!!
Tanner,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021",Great mouse for the price. I like that they include weights. Mouse has an excellent feel. The one complaint I have is the sensitivity adjustment is right next to the left mouse button and I occasionally accidentally change the sensitivity while playing but you can lock it so that it can’t happen.
Bill,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","Just as described, no issues. The standard model has been my go to mouse for years, these are awesome for about any type of game you want to play, smooth and durable. The ability to set up the weight dist is one of those features you didn't know you needed untill you have it."
Jenna,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2020","Really like this mouse. The feel is nice, the side buttons are really well placed. The only gripe I have is about the Logitech G HUB software. That has been a nightmare that i have had to reinstall 3 times now over the months."
YouLoveRik,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2021",I like this mouse for the texture its like a rubber feel for non slip when you getting sweaty hahaaa and the thumb rest with the extra buttons 😍. Still want a bigger mouse for my hand but this is amazing.
Matthew J. Baluyot,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2021","Upgraded from a 7-year-old Logitech MX518 and the sensor on the mouse feel incredibly smooth, comparatively. Personally, the shape of the mouse is ideal. Very happy with the purchase."
Gaby,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2020",Look it’s a great mouse and in my opinion the best but be careful while buying this mouse because my package said delivered and it was in someone else’s house like ten houses down the block
D. McCarthy,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2020",My son loves this mouse. He is an avid gamer and has always complained about the functionality of other gaming mouse(s) he has used in the past. This was a great price and great product
Mateo,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2021","Thanks for make a great mouse, the driver in windows run very well but in macOs doesn't work very good."
Raymond,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2020",I love the feel of the mouse and the weight dist. is a plus. Put weights to where you feel the most needed for gaming.
Chan Family,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2020",you can place little weights inside the mouse so that you cna control your mouse easier. Also good response in my 4K resolution monitor.
Ethan Burke,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2020","I love the fact that I can change the weight of the mouse, it is a well rounded mouse not to heavy, not to light,"
rygers,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2021","So far no issues hook up easy and feels great, immediate response. Hope it lasts."
Laura Ingrao,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","Great mouse, long time owner of this brand. Would highly recommend."

Shawn Michael Norman,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","I saw this mouse on sale for $24 at a local big box store. I purchased it since I had some extra birthday money. I use it mostly for playing MMO style games. The extra buttons are great for my use case. The weights and the dpi settings are very nice. This mouse fits my hand perfect and I really love it. I have never seen a mouse so good for $24. I would pay plenty more for this mouse as it is the best I have ever used personally. If your on the fence, buy it!"
Sivar,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2021",Overall this is a great mouse for gaming. For someone like me who always used a cordless heavier mouse the variable weight system has made the adjustment to the G502 SE HERO very smooth.
Zak Waldschmidt,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023","This is the best mouse I have used, I honestly have it saved in my cart so if it ever breaks that I can just reorder the same mouse. I love the feel of it when I am gaming and the front buttons make it very easy to setup quick macro keys when playing games. The sensitivity options are great as well and allow you to play at many different sensitives and easily rotate between them."
Jason Schlaht,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020","This mouse works very good. I've used it a lot in FPS games. Has ability to change the amount it weighs, and is very accurate. The software works good to customize it's dpi."
