Rick,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024",The most was hard to stop jumping around. The wheel would keep rolling almost all of the time. I think this mouse I bought was just a bad one. I as replacing an older model that just pooped out. Maybe another one by Logitech would work. Not sure if I want to try again just yet.
joel,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2020","This is honestly not a bad mouse, couple things to complain about tho, first is the weight of it at 117g, which literally newer wireless mice weigh less. Second is the square button on the side below the other two buttons which is kinda hard to reach. The last is the fact the rgb in this is pretty minimal (im a rgb fanatic) logitech has some plain rgb settings, kinda ruins my current build cuz i have rgb everywhere. Logitech GHUB also sucks as a software, honestly the previous software logitech gaming software is so much better, and ive switched to that
Edit: Ordered a razer basilisk ultimate (I was very skeptical of razer as they are known to be crap, however, the basilisk ultimate I bought and owned for 2 years now is leagues better than this piece of crap). If youre looking for the g502 ""feel"" get the basilisk ultimate, however if you require the infinite scroll wheel, id recommend getting the regular g502 for $50, so even if it breaks, it wont break your bank

Edit: i bought this mouse on august and the stupid thing has this this issue where the left mb double clicks and the right mouse button wont register a hold! ive already ordered a return as this mouse was the worst purchase ive made so far, save your money get something else"

I ordered new wireless mouse but I received USED DIRTY WIRED MOUSE. It was not even in the proper Logitech box, just in a bubble mailer."

I've had logitech peripherals for 20ish years now as my go to for gaming. Ghub has been garbage for years and there is no fix in sight. I would like to see if my wireless gear is dying.

Jake Adkins,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2021","After buying you will have an issue known as the ""double-click issue"". I won't bother explaining it as I'm sure others already have, just buy another mouse. DO NOT buy this one or you will regret it. I was lucky enough to use this for a year before it had the issue. Some others have had the issue within a few days of use."

Harsh Parmar,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","Not sure what is going on with logitech mouse products these days?! another broken scroll wheel, Im done. Moving to asus. refunding, be cautious"
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2020","Great mouse for 2 months, no complaints. After two months the double and tripple clicking left click begins, a problem that all the recent logitech mice are apparently having due to cheap crappy switches. Not sure when logitech took the budget route on their hardware, but i will personally never buy anyother logitech product again."
Chad,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2020","I used the wired G502 for a few years and really enjoyed it so I decided to upgrade to go wireless. After only a couple months of moderate use, the left button started double clicking and making constant phantom clicks, making it impossible to do many basic tasks such as highlighting text. Until they improve the switches I can't recommend buying any of the new Logitech mice as they all seem to have this issue."
