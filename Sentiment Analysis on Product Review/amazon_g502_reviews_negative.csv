katt,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2020","G502 Hero Mouse from Logitech, Review.

I've been buying the ""Inferior"", non-""sick!"" G300s several years.
I've owned owned a total of three G300's.
Even though the G300s physically decay like cake in the rain, I strongly recommend buying a G300s instead of this G502 piece of absolute garbage.

LET ME EXPLAIN:
To start, the Hand-Feel for me is really bad, and I usually end up holding it in a way that makes reaching two of the Thumb buttons very awkward.
I normally get Ambidextrous mice , so that's my fault.
And really, it's also my fault for having strange hands.
But that's not what makes the G502 the worst mouse I've touched in over a decade.

NEGATIVES:
What is NOT my fault is the overly sensitive Click Pressure on all the face and side buttons.
I don't know if that's an intended feature, or I just got mouse from a lot that was over-tuned.
But it's far too easy to accidentally click when sliding the mouse across the pad.
ANY resistance from your surface and CLICK!
Glance any part of a button that isn't the exact center: CLICK!
Gently feel for where the buttons are in the dark, while being careful to use far less force than should reasonably be needed to depress a button far enough to engage the mechanism : CLICK! CLICKCLICK! CLICK.

MORE NEGATIVES:
The Mouse Wheel has to be some cruel experiment in psychological warfare.
The Lock/Unlock implementation warrants detailed comment in both states.
Beyond the fact that it is an unwanted feature at the best of times -- when gaming, it will actively hinder your enjoyment and performance -- unless you dedicate your life mastering it, and I have no intention of doing anything remotely close to that.

* As a free spinning wheel, it fails due to floatiness.
Unless you just want to rip-scroll through several pages of product reviews on Amazon to record for a video project, it has no use case that is superior to any other scrolling function available to users, and that includes the Middle Mouse Button scrolling that the mouse still possesses (I'll get to MMB issues later).

* As a tick wheel, it FAILS because the ratchet is far too loose to be trusted.
You get this awful effect where physically, the wheel will ""back rock"" or fore rock"" to cradle itself between the teeth.
This then causes your scroll selection to tick up or down onto something other than your intent.
Not always, mind you.
But enough (and unpredictably so) to seriously impede, if not, ruin whatever gaming moment you might have been having.

Further exacerbating the issue is you cannot change the internal DPI of the mouse wheel sensor.
Not with your OS, not with G HUB, not with ANYTHING...
You can only change how your Operating System MULTIPLIES the Wheel Motion.
And even with a 1:1 multiple, you get that selection rocking issue.
And anything LESS than 1:1 results in no scrolling whatsoever unless you unlock and rip-scroll.

MOAR NEGATIVES:
Oh and this is all before the issues of trying to get a clean Click out of the Middle Mouse Button buried under this infernal, Chroenburgian assembly.
It feels like trying to command a Two year old into behaving, using only soft verbal warnings, while sliding supine across a frozen lake, while also being used as hockey puck by competing teams of various drunken Canadian bears and moosen.

This would be an absolutely great mouse to lend to your competition.
if this was the design intent, hat's off to ya.

But, to put everything I've said even more viscerally...
I want to rip the wheel out of the mouse with my teeth and grind it until my gums bleed.
It's rare that I'm passionate at all about a design feature.
But this wheel, I HATE IT.
I want the person who designed it to feel as bad about making it, as I do trying to use it.
NEVER REVISIT THIS DESIGN EVER AGAIN.

You just don't get it.
It literally adds a layer of anxiety and distrust to EVERY SINGLE THING done with this mouse.
Even the tasks that have nothing to do with scrolling at all.
The fact that you know this boobytrap is a centimeter from your finger is all it takes.

Oh yeah. AND IT'S LOUD!
It doesn't even have the common courtesy to make a satisfying noise.
NO!
Shifting a from 4th Gear to Reverse at Highway speed in your uncle's rustbucket Camaro is less audibly jarring!

POSITIVES:
The software is actually fairly good.
With the caveat that you cannot change the Wheel DPI nor the Wheel Up/Down command assignments (wth?).

The Motion is spot on, but that's baseline expectation for a +$50 Mouse
And the Weight system is a fine option, even if I'm most comfortable taking all the wrights AND THE DOOR off.

CONCLUSION:
The G502, in my humble opinion (at least THIS one I personally received) may as well be eWaste.
I genuinely tried ""Getting Used to It"".
I gave the thing several months.
But as a result, I can no longer return it.

Seriously, Logitech.
If you would just use the G502's Software, Motion Sensor and Moulded Plastic Quality for the next iteration of the G300s series: I'd buy that day one.

Give the next G300s a SOLID wheel with a strong ratchet and Side-Pivot lateral scrolling.
You could even toss in a Thumb Toggle/Switch for DPI shifting or whatever.
All these things have mechanically solid examples in your other products.

Paint the dang thing Gold, charge $80, and call it the ""G399gg Great Golden Calf Edition"".
I don't care.
Just stop with these ridiculously over-designed ""srz gam3r"" fad features.
YOU. ARE. NOT. RAZER.
YOU. SHOULD. BE. BETTER. THAN. RAZER.

PS. I purchased this mouse via a recommendation from a friend.
Whom (upon finding out only too late) never uses the mouse wheel, extra buttons or G HUB.
So yeah, 5-Stars if you just want an overpriced 2-button Mouse."
J Allen,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024","Mouse wouldn't even register with my PC. Sat on the phone for 2.5 hours with Logitech Support, after multiple transfers finally ended up with someone in the right department. Explained the issues, that the drivers weren't working under my Device Manager, and G Hub wouldn't even detect it. Tried all the fixes I could find online to no avail. The Logitech Support man named Richard said it would be no problem, and since it was recently purchased and I sent him proof from my Amazon recepits, that they could send me a replacement, and also tried to tell me the mouse is just a plug & play, and doesn't need updated drivers. I combed through Reddit and found dozens if not a hundred people having problems with their Logitech Mice. Anyway, I digress, he told me that their warranty replacement would take up to 10 days, and to try through Amazon first, and if that didn't work, send him an email on the same chain. I went and started the refund through Amazon, and came to realise I would have to send the Mouse back, wait for their confirmation, then wait for a replacement. The ""defective mouse"" took 2 weeks to come here intially, so I responded in the email back to Logitech Support guy Richard, telling him I would rather do the warranty through them. This all happend on 04/23/2024. It is now 4/30/2024, and I have been ignored by Logitech Support for a week. I have since sent them 3 emails, and no response. The fact that you have to have a specific program on your computer just to update the drivers for a mouse is ridiculous, on top of that, the fact that it doesn't even detect it's own products is a load of bull. Luckily my old mouse still works besides the scroll button(which is why I went for a new one in the first place).

I do have a Logitech Steering Wheel and pedals that work just fine, and something like that is understandable for getting G Hub, but a mouse? It's safe to say I will never purchase another Logitech product again. I'll just eat the money I spent on this I guess, maybe it will work on someone else's computer. Just ordered a Red Dragon Mouse. Kick rocks Logitech..."
ASBaumgarten,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019","Update Aug 29, 2019: I submitted a support ticket to Logitech a week ago, and I have not gotten any response from their support other than the initial confirmation with the support ticket number. The same day I submitted my support ticket I went and bought a SteelSeries Rival 600 to hold me over until I would hopefully receive a replacement from Logitech, but after using the Rival 600 I can say I will not be going back to Logitech for a gaming mouse ever again.

TL;DR: This mouse has a sensor issue present in both of the ones I have and the 2nd one I received directly from Logitech support had developed an issue with its right-click in only 3 months of use.

I got the G502 HERO as a replacement to my long time favorite mouse the G502 Proteus Core. The decision to upgrade was due to natural wear on the Proteus Core from over years of use along with the desire to have better software support for managing mouse profiles and settings through the newer Logitech G HUB software.

My first HERO mouse arrived at the beginning of April, and from day one I had some issues getting the thing configured. With the Proteus Core I had been using the Logitech Gaming Software to manage profiles, lights, and configurations but I want to make sure I was using the recommended software with the new HERO mouse. I opted to uninstall the LGS so that I could install G Hub without any worry of problem or conflict between the two pieces of software. When attempting to install G Hub it would get stuck at the ""Downloading and Installing"" part of the installer, and this was after leaving it be for almost an hour. After killing the install process, I scoured my systems for remnants of LGS from AppData folders to Registry entries to make sure I deleted anything that could cause conflict. Upon rebooting I attempted to install G Hub again only to yield the same issue I encountered before all of this taking on Windows 10 Pro 1809 at the time. Since I couldn't get the G Hub software working I figured I would have to reset or reinstall Windows to make sure the software was working with a blank slate, but I was not about to reinstall my whole OS to test that theory just to get my mouse to work so I resorted to reinstalling LGS to get my new HERO mouse configured.

Now that the mouse had been configured to my preferred button layout and DPI setting, I was able to starting using it normally. To make sure everything felt normal I quickly went through a couple of my regular games to verify that my muscle memory was still relevant since the HERO is the exactly same form factor as the Proteus Core. The new mouse was proving to be what I had hoped for, barring the earlier dilemma with the software.

Over the course of April I occasionally had something very strange happen while in use; at random times without predictors or warning my cursor on screen would shoot to one of the corners of my screen and get pinned there. In FPS games this would cause my character to suddenly start staring at the ground or the sky while rapidly spinning in one direction, indicating that the mouse was perceiving continuous horizontal and vertical inputs despite the mouse being stationary. This could only be interrupted by lifting the mouse off of the mousepad, a CORSAIR MM600, and setting it back down, which would stop the constant input and everything would go back to normal. In over 6 years of gaming on PC, 3 of which were with the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I had never encountered any issue like this with any of the Razer or Logitech mice I had used up to that point.
Come mid May the issue had persisted, so I found a day to reinstall Windows 10 to the latest version 1903 in the hopes that finally being able to run the G Hub software would somehow magically fix what I believe to be a sensor issue with the mouse itself. With Windows 10 1903 installed, the G Hub software finally complete its own installation without an issue, but the cursor still continued to randomly get pinned to a corner of the screen without warning.

Since I had confidently ruled out software, I decided to contact Logitech support. After explaining everything to the support agent, they decided that they would send me a new replacement mouse which arrived only a few days later. Within only a couple weeks I experienced the cursor issue again with the replacement HERO mouse from Logitech support, but it seemed to happen less often so I dealt with it.

It has been over 3 months since getting the replacement and now the replacement had developed its own issue with the right-click being unable to be consistently held down.

I want to love this mouse, but unless Logitech can improve their QC I cannot recommend them at this time."
Colin M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2021","I wanted to like this mouse. I like the position of the buttons (particularly the toggle DPI that lets you have a ""snipe"" button - more mice need that) and the general shape of the mouse, but it's just got so many problems, including abysmal build quality (which is shocking for logitech)

For starters, it's weirdly draggy and a bit heavy, even wired and with zero weights in it. I can't see anyone wanting to add more of the included weights - the point of this kind of mouse is to start LIGHT and let you tune it, not start heavy and let you make it worse. Genuinely heavier than my full size WIRELESS teknet mouse that I use for my media PC.

The feet lasted okay, they're starting to feel worn after a year of use on an aluminum banshee pad mousepad (I usually got about 2-3 years out of a set of feet on a Razer Deathadder) And they're very sensitive to picking up schmutz. Replacement feet are not readily found, you're gonna be using teflon tape. The combination of really meh feet and really heavy/draggy weight makes the mouse wildly imprecise after only a couple months. Even with teflon tape over the feet, I still can't make a ""clean"" drag across my mousepad with a smooth cursor movement. Not even sure it would when it was new. The aforementioned teknet mouse still absolutely glides after years. I think it's just because the 502 has SIX absolutely gigantic pads, and other mice I use tend to have 3 or 4 much smaller feet at most, which keeps the inherent friction lower.

Cord is okay if used with a mouse bungie.

The scroll wheel is abysmal. It has a side/side rock, which is already not good for a proper gaming mouse (they all have a habit of mis-registering mouse 3 clicks) but this is easily the worst I've ever experienced. I am used to the design, but this one is so bad and vague that I had to straight up disable the rocker, so now I only get about 15% of my middle clicks mis-sensed. The ability to unlock a scroll wheel is nice when I have to turbo scroll through a 300 page document, but again, in GAMING practice, is just one more way the scroll wheel feels incredibly vague and inaccurate.

mouse 4 is just set too far back. You have to press it with the knuckle of your thumb, which requires an incredibly awkward ""palm pinch"". If you use all the mouse buttons in a game, you're going to hate this thing so much.

And the thing is INCREDIBLY fragile. My first one's left click broke just sliding off my chair onto carpet, the whole mouse button itself sheared off. The second one's L2 switch itself is now failing, as it registers right click but doesn't register HOLDING it. After only a year, this is appalling. If you play MMO's, this makes steering an absolute nightmare. If you play FPS games, right click iron sight/scope becomes agony.

And there's something about this mouse that gives me really sweaty palms, which is weird because I have a kind of hybrid palm/fingertip grip that keeps my palm usually hovering just above the mouse

My deathadder was only replaced by this mouse because I suspected the skin flakes embedded in the chassis had evolved a new form of life. This one is getting hucked in the garbage because it fell to pieces in a little over a year and a half. I am staying away from Logitech for a few years after two absolutely atrocious peripherals and going back to the good old iron duke of a Razer Deathadder."
kingXspian,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","This is why I don't do reviews immediately on any products after recieve because its a waste of time to read. Best to buy now, wait like a year or 2 and see if its worth it in the future without wasting a dime. If its defective? Review now. If its working right? Review later in case its not working in the future.

Reviewing 05/16/2024
Mouse was great running in the beginning, very well done for FPS gaming. Everything was fine until now. The scroll wheel? Started messing up yesterday on 05/15/2024. When you scroll your mouse wheel up? It scrolls down. When I scroll my mouse down? Doesn't do anything. If I were you? I'd stop buying Logitech products until they improve it. Keyboard, Mouse, etc. Its not worth wasting your money on this mouse. Many people have complained in the google research. Its messes up in the beginning then works after a min or so.

Use fakespot review and they will help you in the long run.

Pros:
Great gaming mouse.
Precise point
Great DPI

Cons:
Horrible Mouse Scroll within a year or 2.

I thought it was going to last long. Boy I was wrong."
Uncommon Corgi,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021","Generally, you hear a lot of good things about Logitech mice, but this one might possibly be the best one from them. Between being able to customize the other buttons on your mouse, on top of your DPI, but it also has an unlockable mouse wheel. Scrolling through a big inventory, or a long thread online? Unhinge that bad boy, blare some eurobeat, and rip your finger off of the wheel.

The wheel itself is comfortable, and really sturdy when you're clicking, or even scrolling. The other buttons don't get in the way of your clicks, and the wheel lock is completely out of the way when you're using it.

The only (probably personal) issue I have so far is, my mouse does glitch out, and moves either in one direction, or spasms. I don't have any dust, nor debris on my mouth, so I'm unsure if I have a faulty mouse, or it could be one of those model-specific issues.

Regardless of that, this is a really nice mouse for its price. The firmware is great (not needed), the mouse is comfortable, and if you're a fan of weighted mice like I am, it has a sizeable, adjustable weight you can fit inside.

---

This is an update to the review I have written in the past, as things have gone an unfortunate route since then.

A few months after I bought this mouse, I began to have problems. On occasion, my cursor would bounce erratically, or slide as if my mouse had disconnected like it were wireless, which is what I've previously mentioned in my original review. These issues were negligible at first, but they progressively got worse over time. It got to the point that playing games got very hard to play because of this fault. Of course, I thought my mousepad might have been dirty, or there could have been some grime/dust on the laser that was causing this, however, this isn't the case.

I recently upgraded a few peripherals, including a brand new mousepad, which is entirely clear of any mess. I bought this mouse again, seeing how the old one is already falling apart after having it for almost a year. The moment I plug in my mouse, I almost immediately begin to have the same issue; erratic bouncing mouse, and a sliding cursor. I even double checked it on a laptop to confirm it wasn't my hardware, and it was, in fact, the mouse I had JUST bought.

I don't know what it is with Logitech mice, as this is the second variant of Logitech mice I've bought that's been awfully faulty, but I will not be buying Logitech brand items anymore. It's ridiculous that my lightweight, casual use of them acts like I'm beating the mouse against my desk, and throwing it against the wall. It's such a shame, because I really liked the firmware, design, and feel of the mouse. They've lost my business, and any further recommendations to friends. If you're going to spend some money, go to a better brand, like Corsair."
Legal Eagle,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","The mouse seems decently made with one extremely significant exception - the scroll wheel is totally unanchored / unweighted.

You know how when you normally use a scroll wheel on a mouse, there's either some resistance to the movement of the wheel and/or it ""clicks"" every time you make an increment in movement? Yeah, this doesn't do that, it's completely smooth. That would be ok if there was some resistance to the movement of the wheel, but there just isn't.

What that means is that every time you move the mouse, the scroll wheel will move, even if you aren't touching it or are barely grazing it with your finger. That means if you are using any program that cares about the scroll wheel (internet browser, anything with text, video games that use the wheel, etc.) then the screen will start --randomly moving around-- anytime you are using the mouse.

Notably, this isn't something that can be cured by a software setting, because it's caused by the physical construction of the mouse itself - there's no resistance to scroll wheel movement, so if you happen to hold the mouse in such a way that your fingers touch the wheel (almost impossible not to) then this is not the mouse for you.

A shame, really, because it seems to be decently designed otherwise. But I was driven mad within 2 hours of use of this mouse because my computer appeared to be possessed by some sort of devious force that was moving everything when I didn't want it to."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","Logitech dominated the market for well over a decade with consistently high quality mice and elegant software.

The G502-HERO mouse I received has significant issues with the scrollwheel that I could not troubleshoot with the mouse's guide, Logitech's website, various forums, and relevant YouTube videos. This is supposed to be one of their flagship gaming mice.

The once intuitive ""Logitech Gaming Software"" has undergone many changes, all for the worse. While the superior previous versions are left unsupported.

A new software they offer, ""G Hub"", is bloatware that is hellbent on getting you to create an account or register your devices. No one wants to make an account or register their mouse, keyboard, or headset. Period. G Hub's primary goal is to spread its tendrils into as many ""gaming relevant"" apps and programs as it can and run them in the background."
Eddie C,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2020","Hype and marketing aside, this mouse has serious flaws, immediate quality control ones as well as general design ones.

The BAD:

This mouse doesn’t glide side-to-side or up-and-down as much as it scratches and grinds all over the place. Issue here is the new and NOT improved weight system. Unlike the old push-of-a-button slide out tray on G500, the boomerang shaped weights need to be wedged into the bottom of the mouse once you pop the side corner and peel off the underside. (By the way, this is completely counter intuitive and not mentioned in the tiny sheet of a paper that passes for a “manual”. Instead you are supposed to find an official YouTube video by Logitech describing the procedure. What?! What happened with the button-push system?) The entire door is held, barely at that, by a super weak 1g magnet and two tiny plastic latches that seem like a major part endurance oversight. (No way they won’t break at some point in the future).

As reported on reddit and elsewhere, the mouse underside weights compartment door does not close all the way. There is some give and it makes the mouse uneven on the bottom. That said, even removing the weights AND the door entirely, the mouse will still scratch and grate since the mouse feet elsewhere were positioned unevenly ( There are no feet positioned on right side at all for example, which makes the mouse uneven door-issue-aside.). All of this can be mitigated by not using the G502 on a hard surface like wood, glass, or those new “pro-gamer” plastic or metal pads. But even on a cloth mat after a few hours there were tracks and tiny rips in the cloth material. Wow, Logitech!? How the mighty have fallen!

Another issue is plastic. Cheap plastic everywhere that is. Nowadays even never-heard-of-brands making “Cool Gamer RGB overload” mice for $10-$15 come with rubberized coating. Other than the side grips, the entirety of G502 is cheap slick plastic which will make the mouse slide around… well, grind around let’s be honest. Also, it has been shrunken in all possible dimensions compared to G500. It is narrower, shorter and much lower than the G500. Seems like something designed for your average teenage/tween hand, which I’m sure is the target demographic now anyway.

All in all, all of the above can explained by down-costing. This mouse (G502) screams “cut-costs”, for the manufacturer that is. You, the user, are still expected to pay 2 to 2.5 times as much as you did for the G5 or G500 10-15 years ago while getting something much inferior. Smaller, more plasticky with horrible QC and design decisions. (The underside of the mouse does not shut clean making the bottom of the mouse uneven? How was this overlooked?! And then made by the million?)

The GOOD:

The sensor is top notch. While not majorly improved, the increase in precision is noticeable and measurable vs G500 for instance. Jitter is lower and bizarre acceleration issues seem to be non-existent on G502. Cord is pretty nice. Extremely flexible and seems to be of high quality. Something easily frayed G500 cord could have used. Logitech software is still intuitive, relatively low resource, and available in most common language including English.

Summary:

Downcosted all around, overly plasticky, poor quality control, worse than poor design choices, lack of rubberized coating where needed, shrunken, shrunken, tiny, TINY, mouse. 10 years ago this would have been a… well, still a downgrade to a G500, but not many options were as available back then, so it might have been an option of some kind. Now, even no-name “Gamer-Cool” brands come with decent enough software, (macros, RGB configurability, profiles, DPI tweaking and all), rubberized coating, latest Pixart sensors, weight systems, you name it, all for under $20, sometimes even for under $15. It seems the no-names have gotten a bit better, if not a whole lot better and name brands like Logitech have gotten a bit worse and down-costed to the absolute maximum, so now everything sits in the middle and luck-of-the-draw is what rules the day and the mouse pad.

I would say G502 is on par with your average random $15 no-name brand “Gamer-Cool” mouse on Amazon, but even those have rubberized coating, proper height and size for a grown man’s hand, and actual metal feet. How the mighty have fallen..."
Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2020","It seems logitech has either a quality control problem or a supply problem because the switches in these mice are absolute garbage. The mouse is honestly one of the best mice I have ever used while it worked - until it didn't. Less than a year old and $75 gets you a mouse that feels great in the hand until the scroll wheel starts jumping around and the left click starts randomly double clicking, and then not clicking at all - all intermittently. There are numerous reviews out there one can find by simply googling ""g502 double click"" in which people either return them and hope their next one doesn't do the same, refund them, or the more technical self swap of a mechanical switch for the left click.

I will not be going any of these routes and I'm sad to say it because Logitech used to be a staple in PC peripherals. Now it's not the plastic it's made of.

edit: As I write this update, I have actually taken another star off for the true, 1 star review. I typically don't believe in one star reviews because it's generally an overreaction and everything is either 5 stars great or 1 star horrible, but Logitech has sunken to the 1 star territory. After literally 15 emails back and forth with Logitech support, I had to use their website to prove I was having a double click issue, which was easily done, but had to film both myself, the mouse, and the serial number from the mouse in the video while doing it. I could easily reproduce the double click fault in both the left AND right click function and sent proof. I sent my mouse back to Logitech on approx the 10th of January 2020. They received my mouse the 15th of January 2020. I don't hear anything for 8 days until I first contact them again asking for an update. Still nothing. Finally I receive an email stating that my product is not faulty, and therefore doesn't qualify for the warranty. Nevermind the evidence I had to first email them. Nevermind the 100% reproduce able error in both left and right clicking.

I will never buy a logitech product again.

Do yourself a favor and google 'logitech double click' and question whether you want to buy this mouse, likely have the issue, and then not have the warranty honored. I bought a cheap mouse replacement to tide me over and it works much better anyway."
KGB,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2024","I cannot make it work properly on my built 2 years old PC. The software just doesn't make sense. I cannot go past how to make DPI buttons to work. in a default profile G7 button set to DPI down and G8 to DPI up. But whatever I do it seems they don't work consistently. Most of the time both don't work. Sometimes DPI up works as DPI down, DPI down doesn't work or works for one or two clicks and stops. G6 button DPI shift always works properly. I think I Just gonna give up on this. I didn't have any of this kind of problems with my previous EVGA X20, corsair M55."
Playjon,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024","I bought this in January 2024 and it is now the end of May 2024 and the mouse stopped working. My cursor just disappeared from my screen and my computer stopped recognizing the mouse. I spent an hour on the phone with tech support and did everything they suggested and none of it worked. The tech had no solution and said I would need to talk to customer service. I chatted with customer service the next day. Told them everything that has happened, answered all the questions they emailed me and now nothing. It's been 4 days since I answered their emailed questions and two days since I sent a follow up email. This is supposed to have a two year warranty. If I don't hear from anyone by next week I will be contacting Amazon to see if they will assist."
Deirdre Ettus,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024","Just cons. The wheels feels bad. The toggle feels worse. The front thumb button is in the way. The removable bottom panel jiggles. The bottom of the mouse is not flat, so that if you click too hard (like with the mouse wheel) the entire mouse lifts up off the pad and pivots forward. (Look at a side view image).

I bought this mouse 2 years ago, decided I didn't like it so it sat in it's box. Recently my current mouse died so I tried this logitech again. Still bad. So bad, I had to write a review."
Osman Aktas,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024","I bought it because it was in the first place among the best sellers, but I never thought that I would be so disappointed. Playing games or surfing the internet is pure torture. There are too many buttons and I keep pressing them by mistake. Adjusting mouse sensitivity is a completely different matter. Even though I never adjusted the mouse sensitivity on the mouse I used before, I was able to do my work very easily. But with this mouse, I have to change it constantly. I don't know why, but mouse sensitivity changes even between applications."
Aaron Sheffield,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024","Older version with cloth covered cord was so much nicer. I know it's small things but it just makes me sad that huge companies slowly ruin great products like this. I know my little 1 star won't accomplish anything but hey, a guy can try.

Favorite mouse I've ever had (been through a couple RedDragon, Razer Deathadder, cheap Logitech business class mice, etc.). I play League of Legends and do CAD/3D modeling work so all the buttons get a lot of use, but LoL finally took its toll on the right click after 3 years. I ordered a new one of the exact same mouse because I loved it so much. I was very sad to find that it now comes with a trashy rubber cord instead of the nice cloth braided one from years ago.

Next time I need a new mouse (when I finish school and move to an office), I will be purchasing a Razer Deathadder because they have the decency to keep a nice cable."
Justin P,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2020","The weights are good but standard. The resolution as expected. Button presses require very little force (I would bet the switches would be the first things to fail).

Update few months later: docked two stars, left button has developed switch bounce and now sometimes clicks multiple times with one press of the button.

Update months laterer: Oh man, you're gonna love this. Button got worse (couldn't even drag anything; real fun playing the ""which folder did the file get dropped into?"" game) then the right button started to display similar issues. Logitech did send me a new one, buuuuuut....

It took me a month or two to actually get the warranty process started and it's a huge hassle. Even once the warranty process starts and someone actually contacts you, it's only to give you a many-steps email to get you to do the troubleshooting for them (including removing their own software which makes sense as it's basically malware; it's bad).

They make you, no joke, record a video of you clicking on a website they send you to with:
- the mouse visible,
- the website url visible,
- the ""double click counter"" visible, AND
- a HANDWRITTEN NOTE with the ticket number written on it.

If you can jump through all those flaming hoops and prove that, indeed, the issue you said it had (months ago) was really real they're going to have you then take a picture with:
- the mouse visible,
- the S/N visible (and it has to be the one on the product, not the box), AND
- ... ANOTHER handwritten note with the S/N and the ticket number written on it.

I'll be honest, I expected them to next request I take a picture of myself holding the mouse with the ticket number scratched into my forehead while holding a newspaper like some sort of kidnapping victim. They didn't ask for that, however; instead, they asked for all of my details and sent me a new one.

So, in summary:
- they replaced defective product and I love being able to drag files or select text again, that's one (1) shiny gold star for Logitech added!
- they made the process so painful I'd rather have a cage-match with a gang of feral cats all hopped up on catnip and PCP than go through it again, TWO STAR: MINUS >:-[

If yours develops any issue at all during Amazon return/replace period, do it before that time runs out.

Interestingly, they don't even seem to want the mouse with the bad switch back, which would be an easy/cheap fix. I thought they made me go through all that 'cause they're so expensive to make or something, heck they already spent a lot of money on labor hours, but... nope. That's right, the expensive (well... more than $10) mouse they want you to perform 3 miracles to replace isn't worth shipping that tiny box over."
Bobbie Richardson,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2022","Do you want a mouse that is 100% dependent on software? Do you want a software that conflicts with your other RGB applications? Then this is the mouse for you!

Be amazed at the ""On-board Memory Mode"" of the mouse! As soon as this baby loses connection with Logitech GHUB, it will revert back to factory settings!

Guess you will have to start the Logitech GHUB software to push your setting again just to crash your RGB applications again!

Should we try the ""Allow Games and Applications to control Illumination"" in the settings menu? You can if you want! It will still crash your RGB applications.

Don't forget about that lghub_updater that runs in the background. Once you kill that process, the On-board memory mode on your mouse magically forgets its settings! WOW! Its like the background process keeps pushing data to the mouse to make it look like it stores the settings!

Also, don't you just love when you disable a service called lghub_updater only to have lghub override your settings an reenable it on next startup due to it updating your service list on runtime? What an amazing feature! Its almost at the same intrusiveness as Norton and McAfee.

In all seriousness, this mouse is great but comes with garbage software that conflicts with applications that control RGB.

If you want to program your RGB with a single program, Logitech will make it a living nightmare.

If you just want a simple application that just controls the inputs of your mouse. Logitech will make it difficult to find an application to do only that.

Logitech is horrible when it comes to software that it borders the line as bloatware. But hey, at least they ask you if its alright to gather analytics.

Be prepared to spend hours going through forums to figure out how to get logitech software to play nice with other applications."

Amazing Grace,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021","I have a G502 on my PC, which I use for work. I need different shortcuts on different software and so the G502 works perfectly and the user interface (which has been updated, but I haven’t replaced there) is easy to use.

I got the Hero thinking it would be great to have the same functionality on my Mac which I’m using more now for work since I’m often on the go. Boy was I wrong!

Let’s start with the software: I installed it easily enough but it wouldn’t recognize the mouse. Fine, restarted and it still wouldn’t, uninstalled and reinstalled and restarted before connecting: now it finally did. Great, except figuring out how to program the buttons was a pain largely because it was bugging out hard and things wouldn’t show, I only found out after I had to turn my laptop off to go somewhere else and turning it on again.

Finally, after wasting my lunch and half an afternoon trying to figure it out, I managed to set it up. Great! Except scrolling was inverted and it would go up when I tried scrolling down and viceversa.

“Ok, I’ll fix that on settings” there was no option on settings, so I fixed that on Apple configuration. Fixed! Work time! Except when I had to use the trackpad I came to find out now it was invented! Cue more time wasted on a solution I could not find.

Finally I gave up, willing to suck it up and enjoy my shortcuts that change from program to program, that would be dreamy, at least. Except it wasn’t, because no sooner had I started enjoying them when they stopped working for no reason.

So it’s back to troubleshooting. More wasted time, more restarts and more reinstalls and setups later and best I would get was a couple hours of work before shortcuts crapped out again.

I really wanted this to work so I asked for a replacement. Same problems. I ende up returning it as well.

Apple users: save your time and money. Get something else."
Tea Time,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024","Initially, this was a great mouse. Even without the janky software required to program functions.

Tracking was precise. Comfort is above par for similar in this price range.

That lasted for less than 2 months.

Played. Turned off computer. Did grown up stuff (sleep, work, drive). Try logging back on the computer, hmmm....mouse isn't working. Tried a different usb port. Tried on each of my other 4 computers...must have been a cat in the house, because this mouse failed.

Contacted Logitech. After they wasted 1 hour of my time, they requested serial number, and my personal information and then nothing more.

If you do office work, buy a cheaper comfort mouse. If you game, buy something else. Logitech used to be great, I have some mice that are 10+ years old and still going strong. Not the same quality today and less than helpful customer service."
A. W. Carter,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2021","I don't often play click heavy games like shooters. I mostly play RPG's, Strategy games, or I use my controller, and I regularly using this mouse for general computing. However, I am frustrated that after a little over a year, this mouse developed the same left click issues my last one (Logitech Wired Pro which also lasted a little over a year) did. Whenever I perform a single left click, it often clicks twice and when I hold the left mouse button to drag (like you do all the time in a strategy game or moving files around) it will regularly disengage as if I lifted my finger, even though I am not changing pressure. Nearly every time I single clicked a space in this text box, while writing this review, I selected the word next to the space like I double clicked or the entire paragraph like I triple clicked.

Compounding this issue is my long standing loyalty to this company. I have a Logitech G213 Keyboard, a G935 headset with all the LED's synced, and I have a set of Logitech speakers on my desk that are 15 years old that sound great and still rumble the windows when the bass hits. Even though the last mouse failed, I still bought another, thinking this time would be different. I've been using Logitec products and recommended them to others for years (I work in IT), so It doesn't make me happy that these mice keep failing on me from the company that I love. Seeing as other people are having these issues, I'm never wanting to get another one of these gaming mice again. Might have to start transitioning all my gear to another company soon too. Sad day.

P.S. I switched to an 8 year old Dell mouse I had lying around so I could finish writing and editing this review. Zero issues. Hopefully I can get this repaired via warranty. I will update this review with how that goes."
Timothy J. Wood,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","I bought one of these a while back and pretty quickly noticed that the scroll wheel is just trash. It is sometimes oversensitive, and sometimes just starts sending scroll input even when you aren't touching it. Returned that one.

Some amount of time later, I spilled something on my actual good working mouse, and then like an idiot went to my order list here and reordered the first mouse I saw. New one arrived and the scroll wheel is still utter trash. Sadly I'd been overconfident and tossed the packaging, and also sadly Amaz*n didn't warn me ""are you sure, you've returned this before"".

Don't order. Avoid at all costs."
Rhyto,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019","As a Logitech User I was already satisfied with the G502 Proteus Core though of course over the years the wiring's mesh has frayed so I thought to get a new one and seeing the Hero as only a minor upgrade at a fair price than my original purchase I proceeded to grab it.

It feels great, nostalgic for Proteus Core users and of course with the extra DPI range can make gaming rather engaging albeit a little bit.

For the time being, I enjoy it and would be open to see what else Logitech would do to top it off.

UPDATE: So a notable error has occurred that I felt should be brought up to which I have not found a ""reliable"" solution to yet. In short, over the past couple months I've noticed an odd increase in input from the mouse (sudden multi-clicks) when I was playing Osu! (Rhythm Game I occasionally play) as the ripple indicator as well my Mouse Key Input Tab was registering more hits than usual, even when Click+Dragging for the game.

Before this, I was having some similar issues while playing games on my emulator where my click and drag would reset and interrupt the gameplay. The notable bit is the pressure put on the mouse whether it be lightly pressed or firmly pressed and even after testing the hardware with a click test it now registers that every 10/100 Clicks a double input would occur if pressed lightly though when ""mashing"" the results increase (20-24/100 Clicks) which has me puzzled at what needed to be done.

Overall, the mouse is ""usable"" though for high intensity applications that require precision and such I would not recommend grabbing this mouse as its lifespan was barely over a year and not at all satisfactory for the consumer.

UPDATE: So I attempted to rectify the issue again though after some more time had passed, there is a notable hardware issue with this mouse where your ""left"" clicks registers multiple times with it's sensitive clicking which is a hinderance to ""active"" games like Osu! which require precise clicks and dragging at high speeds. Even playing on emulators is stifling to do where you have to resort to registering your main clicks with the ""right"" button instead of the usual left button. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS

Unless you're willing to adapt to its faults."
McLaren,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","Logitech used to be known for making great premium products. That was a long time ago. These mouses aren’t meant to last long. They’ll work great in the beginning. They have a cheap part that register the click. After a few months, you’ll have problems selecting words, dragging things, etc. You can Google why my house can’t select, undo selection, trouble dragging items. They’d even point you to buy the replacement part here. Mouse was meant to outlast computers, keep functioning for a lifetime. Logitech wants you to buy a new mouse every 6 months."
Morgan Flanders,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020","I am extremely disappointed with this mouse. If you had asked me just one month ago what I thought of it, I'd say ""Great!"" It worked beautifully, it was very comfortable, and I liked all of the easy to access buttons on the side of the mouse.

Earlier this month, I started to notice that the right mouse button wasn't detecting when I clicked. It seemed to do this randomly, and I'm still not certain if it makes a difference where I press down on the button. It seemed like if I kept my finger dead center, it was a little more consistent. Now even that doesn't work. The only thing that seems to reliably get it to detect the click is pressing down VERY hard whenever I right click. In addition, starting yesterday I ran into the same issue others have described where it double-right clicks with only a single click of the button. It's getting to the point where a number of games are becoming almost unplayable, so I have to replace the thing.

Words cannot begin to express my disappointment. I bought some cheap 20$ mouse with less than 4 stars in review and it was one of my favorite gaming mice of all time, lasted me at least a couple of years. This mouse was more expensive and lasted a measly six months, if that. To add insult to injury, I didn't buy the extended protection plan, and the time to replace it has run out. So it looks like I'm stuck with it.

It is possible that what I've experienced is a freak incident. It's possible that this was a ""One in a million"" scenario. Maybe no one else will run into this, maybe I wouldn't run into it again if I bought a new one. But it doesn't really matter, because in this case I'm the one. I do not intend to buy this mouse ever again."
LMCH,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2024","I figured I would give logitech mouses a second chance, after my last one had trouble using the middle button, I thought logitech fixed the issue, but they didnt and wont, as it is a hardware change to make it cheaper to produce.

This one last about a year, then the middle clicks stopped working and scrolling was very hard to do. From what I understand, logitech removed the phyiscal clicking and scrolling part of the middle button and replaced it with a sensor which doesnt last long. Well, this is the last time I buy logitech, they dont plan to fix this issue, they gotta get that profit margin higher for stock bonuses."
Grant Wheatley,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023","I have been using a G502 Proteus Core that I bought used on /r/hardwareswap almost 8 years ago. As most loved Cores, side thumb grip and bottom skates are wearing down. Nothing functionally, but I thought I would try out an ""upgrade"" / ""side-grade"" to a new Hero model while they were on sale for under $40.

Probably just stockholm syndrome for using the same mouse for years but the Hero feels very cheap:

-Feels lighter (but understand the whole mouse market is moving to lighter mice)

-Can hear the locked scroll wheel rattle when moving the mouse horizontally

-The bottom plate covering the weights isn't flush (even without any weights) so the mouse drags

-When right clicking with middle finger, the left side of the mouse would lift up (probably due to the bottom plate issue)

-Very subjective but the plastic felt cheap. I didn't want to include this point but the more I thought about I want to included it to show that there is a different in plastic

-Non-braided cable which I don't mind but the cable was very thin and worried that it could get easy snagged and break.

I tried using the Hero for a few hours but just couldn't overcome its shortcomings and went back to the Core."
"Mike S,",,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2023","Sadly this particular logitech product is either defective or totally unlike any other logitech mouse I have ever owned.

I have been using logitech mice for going on 20 years. I typically swear by their products. Mice, keyboards, sound systems so I consider myself a loyal customer.

A mouse sits under your left/right hand as the case may be. In my case under my right hand. Typically my hand rests its weight on the mouse and that pressure is what moves it. Simple right and totally normal. Now the left and right mouse buttons operate when additional pressure is applied to either button. Not so with this mouse. The buttons activate with just the mere pressure of my fingers resting on the buttons. Any tremor in your fingers ( I am 73 ) results in a sudden activation, error clicks all over the screen. An annoyance out of gaming and a total FAIL while gaming. I suffered this piece of junk for over a week before finally deciding to get rid of it. I can see why it was on sale at nearly 50% off.

I have since requested and received a refund from Amazon pending the return."
Courtney,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023","My opinion changed as of this morning, because suddenly the mouse is glitching out, and not staying connected to the system completely. It will work some of the time, but other times, it just stops responding.

Drivers are up to date, system is up to date, OS and the Logitech G Hub (garbage) can see that the mouse is connected to the computer, but the mouse wont respond. I have treated this mouse better than my own car in terms of care and gentle touch, but like all Logitech products for the last 12 years, they have a short life, and fail randomly.

As for Logitech customer support, as soon as you figure out where they are all at, let the rest of the industry know. They seem non-existent. I have sent support and inquiry tickets for other products, most recently was 9 months ago. Nothing but crickets from their end. They do not communicate.

If it was not for the fact that they are one of only a few companies that have halfway decent products, I would have stopped buying from them years ago. Do not even get me started on Razer. Despite their name, they are about as sharp as a water hose. I stopped buying from them in 2016 after they dishonored a valid warranty."
Greg Ley,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2023","Most things about this mouse are good or great - buttons, ergonomics, etc. However, the scroll wheel does not stay in place. I'll scroll, stop the scroll wheel completely, move my finger away, and the wheel will start spinning again by itself. Alternately, any sudden movement of the mouse will cause the wheel to start spinning by itself, even a small shift. Picking up the mouse and gently setting it down will cause the same motion. It's really noticeable when gently scrolling, because I'll find the spot I need, release the wheel, and it will scroll right back again.

I thought this wasn't a big deal at first, but it is incredibly infuriating to deal with and is untenable in any kind of gaming situation since the wheel will start moving without being touched. I'll be giving this mouse away in hopes that someone can make do with it, but will definitely NOT be buying another."
Wolf,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024","DO NOT BUY.

Jason Rogers,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020","I purchased this mouse less than a year ago and recently began to have issues with the left mouse button registering multiple clicks on press. I went to a web app that shows mouse events and the issue seemed to be caused when any pressure is applied off center (like near the edges of the button). It would register up to 10 clicks if I pressed once along the edges and held down for a few seconds before releasing. I've looked into this problem here/elsewhere and it seems to be faulty switches being used for this series.

Another issue I've had since the beginning has been the middle mouse button. In addition the scrolling up/down and middle mouse click, you can also rock the middle mouse to the sides to click a middle left/right input. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to click the middle mouse button without ""accidentally"" clicking the middle left/right button instead. From comments here, it seems to be a crap-shoot on whether you get a easy to use middle mouse button from this model. I debated on returning the mouse from the start, but I've gotten around this by simply disabling the middle mouse button entirely (and remapping to another button) while keeping the left/right middle mouse buttons functionality...I lost a button on the mouse, but still had plenty mappings for what I used it for (have another MMO mouse for games needing more buttons). My brother has a Razer Trinity mouse and I have another previously mentioned Logitech MMO mouse with this same button feature and have no problems clicking all 3 middle mouse buttons without issue.

I'm going to try to RMA this mouse, but If I could go back I would have returned at the start."

Build quality has taken a nosedive, across all product lines. The mice and keyboards I have bought from 2008 and onwards have only lasted 4 years maximum, but they still felt solid when I opened the packaged and first used them.

zee.rowe,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021","This is the second G502 I bought in my lifetime. I bought this to back up my G903 mouse (that also broke in under 2 years). Now, I bought this G502, because the first one I bought worked really well! It lasted a long while, no issues, and it's what has sold me on keeping on with Logi products. Well, shame on me, because I've been fooled.

What's wrong with this new G502? Plenty.

It just started up, and it's a doozy. The mouse, when sitting still, sends signals to my PC to move my cursor, when... I'm not even... touching the mouse? Not only that, but the mouse seems to disconnect from my pc and reset the DPI to a higher DPI than I'm comfortable with. Basically, the mouse has a spasm and just does its own thing for a little while until it decides to say hello to the pc again.

What was wrong with the G903? Bad, cheap, switches. I did not learn about them until the G903 went kaput. Logi uses cheap switches doomed to fail, fantastic.

After all this, I can't help but to be severely disappointed. I bought this G502 a few days ago, it already has issues. And trust me when I say, you're probably better off biting the bullet and just buying a mouse from a different brand. I certainly don't want to bother trying to get a refund from the stingy corporation that is Logi with cheap switches and horrible customer service.

GG, I got played. It is what it is. Stay away from Logi mice until they decide to actually listen to the hundreds of thousands of people experiencing issues from Logi mice."
JustN,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2022","I’m surprised at how good this mouse is rated. I haven’t owned too many mice, but I can say this one is the worst. I’d prefer an out of the box mouse you get with a new pc over this garbage. The mouse is pretty narrow and doesn’t fit my hand well at all. I have med-large hands (not huge hands). The button placement is quite annoying, especially the thumb button. I’m constantly hitting it by accident when I move the mouse to the right. The dpi buttons look and feel similar to the other buttons next to it and intuitively feel backwards from what they are… granted, I can probably reprogram this in the software. Honestly, the only thing I like about this mouse is the Logitech software. If the mouse falls, it flys apart since it’s held together with magnets. Also, after it fell, the roller is now practically unusable since even just a light touch intended to scroll will now middle click. My left click started sticking after just a couple months making it a terrible gaming mouse. I’d recommend avoiding this mouse unless you have tiny hands that won’t keep hitting the extra buttons placed where a normal person grips. When my bro hops on my pc he tells me every time how bad this mouse sucks! A trackpad is probably better for gaming than this."
Anthonie M,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","Didn't like this mouse at all. Bought to gain extra buttons to use in the game War Thunder, but was overall vastly inferior to me to the HyperX Pulsefire I previously used. The scroll wheel is extremely sensitive and has a mind of its own, and the mouse does not move around well on my mousepad compared to the HyperX. It almost feels as if it is sticking ever so slightly which the HyperX does not do. This issue is extenuated by the fact that the mouse is EXTREMELY sensitive so any times it gets stuck become compounded by the overcorrection and can lead to missed shots. Overall very disappointed even though I got it on sale (50%) and would be downright furious if I bought it for full price. Would absolutely not recommend and will instead be purchasing the HyperX Pulsefire Raid instead."

Jenny Ann Zhang,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2020","purchased 3/14/2020. start noticing left click/drag tends to double click after about 2 months use. today is 6/4/2020, problem is more persistent, pretty much will not drag/click hold on left mouse click. running latest driver, using Logitech G Hub with profile, mouse cleaned so no dust/derbies inside.

Decided to google this problem and did what i could based on all reddit/forum advises and nothing helps. But one thing is consistent, this problem is a common issue with this mouse and support is minimal from logitech, i have a ticket put in now through their site as they note a ""2-year limited hardware warranty"" for this product as of 6/3/2020. According to some people this issue is due to a ""switch"" that needs to be replaced/soldered, but if you do this you will void all warranty.

Just google the problem yourself and decide if this is the right mouse for you. I really should've stuck w the razer deathadder instead of trying this out.

****UPDATE 2/15/2021:
currently on my FOURTH replacement from Logitech. left click failed on all 3 after about 3-4 month of normal usage, no heavy gaming done. essentially, if you click and hold on a double click site that logitech provides for mouse tests for when you report a mouse issue to them, the click counter will keep rising. Left click does NOT hold after a few month of usage. while my friend recommended this mouse to me and has not had an issue, I'm currently on my FOURTH logitech hero as of yesterday. replacement takes 3-4 weeks time and it is tedious. I do not recommend and cannot recommend people getting this mouse as this product is EXTREMELY unreliable."
Asanti,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","This thing kind of sucks. For you to use any of the custom buttons you have to have ghub open all the time. There's an onboard memory option, but it doesn't really work for custom options like Steam and Discord commands. The worst part is the scroll wheel. The scroll wheel is so loose and sensitive and you can't even change it. Without exaggeration just tapping the thing makes web pages scroll sometimes. It's especially annoying in games that use the mouse wheel to switch between items. Would not buy again, especially for how much it costs."

Adam,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2021","Update: Wasn't happy with this mouse to begin with but recently it's had issues with the cursor jumping intermittently. The chat bot on their website told me an agent will contact me almost three weeks ago now with still no response.

----
I owned the predecessor of this mouse for a very long time (before a ""hero"" version existed) and loved it. I didn't even look around for other mice before buying this one. The mouse itself seems to look pretty much the same, but the software is vastly different and worse and makes configuring the mouse miserable.

Some of the app's features flat out don't even work, like muting audio input. The app's interface is also awful. There are only a few settings but almost a dozen different screens with mostly redundant information and options. Everything is just disabled if you prefer on-board settings. You cannot directly edit an on-board profile, which was a core functionality of the previous app. It may be better if you wanted to use the 'game profiles' feature but I think that's a sad excuse to permanently run a spyware program that scans all your installed programs and processes just for your mouse settings (just use the games' settings...).

The old app and onboard setting had its issues but actually worked, so I find these problems to be pretty glaring.

Update 2/22: this mouse has intermittent jumping issues and the software has not improved. Will be buying a replacement from another manufacturer and if I could return this one still I would. Very disappointing."
Jessica Lee,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2024","The wiring is having connective issues already, tried on two different computers so I know it is from the mouse itself.

At first it works great but now issue after issues."
Bailey,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2022","I was extremely happy with this mouse for the first couple of months that I had it, until I began noticing an issue with the primary mouse button registering single clicks as two near-instantaneous clicks. For anyone who enjoys gaming, they can probably infer that this is a horrible issue. For example, if you're using a grappling hook that requires one click, and you're high up risking fall damage... Guess what. Your grapple hook just went out because your mouse registered two clicks instead of one, and now the cooldown is causing you to fall to your death. This isn't an uncommon issue either, and logitech is very well; however, their upper management has put policies in place to make it unreasonably prohibitive to acquire a replacement mouse. By the time I was done sending in all of the screenshots of click-register testing, pictures of the mouse and serial numbers, I gave up because I had other things going on in my life to the point where I'd probably pay $40 just to tell Logitech to shove the mouse up a place where no light can be shone.

From what the Logitech rep told me, the switch issue that is present (and has been present for 1-2+ years) is prevalent in many mouse manufacturers. Strange how they haven't implemented a fix yet, though... OR offered a better warranty/replacement program that is a *little* bit more accessible."

Kandice,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2019","This would be a wonderful mouse other than the constant click/double click issue. The first one I had for a very short time. During that time I was doing a lot of gaming/designing and the click issue showed up very quickly. Amazon was great and provided an exchange. During the time I had the new one, I was not doing as much gaming/designing so the click issue took longer to show up. I am convinced this is a design flaw in the mouse itself. I will not purchase another one of these. The price is not worth it at all with the click issue. To be clear, the click issue is that when you click or try to click and drag, the mouse either doesn't hold the click or double clicks. I have tested this extensively. If it wasn't for that issue, this mouse would be wonderful. However, this creates a lot of issues with gaming, graphic design and so much more when trying to work and renders the mouse almost useless because of productivity."

Gundam,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020","This was a really great mouse prior to it developing a double left click issue under a year of use. I did some digging online and found that this seems to be due to their mouse switches.

I've been a big Logitech fan since the G15 and G9 days. I'm currently still using a G13 and G910 but I will be avoiding Logitech mice going forward. I'm currently thinking about going back to Razer mice due to this cheaping out on the switches issue to save a few dollars.

Logitech, if you are reading this: if you need to charge an extra 5 dollars to put great switches in your mice, then DO IT! Making cheap products like this only hurts your brand and will make people move away from you. I went from Razer mice to Logitech because their mice had a fraying issue with their cords and Logitech was one of the first to start making them with a reinforced wire to prevent it! Looks like I'm going back to Razer as the tables have turned now. Fix your products Logitech!

I'm just glad I still have my older G502 Proteus Core and Proteus Spectrum mice to fall back on for the time being as those had switches that don't seem to have the issue.

RMA is not worth it to me as I've read the review people have had them go bad again due to their bad switches. It's not worth my time and or money of sending this back and forth."

But they changed the design to a less premium rubber cable and did not notify customers or lower the price. The old ones had a nice braided cable they did not tangle, kink, or get in the way. They took their amazing product and made it cheaper and crappier without reducing the price. Classic bait and switch. I'd advise to go look for a new brand if you can't find one of the older more premium models."

Richard,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2021","Just holding this mouse makes my wrist cramp, it forces a claw-grip with your pinky and ring finger to hold the mouse and is extremely uncomfortable when you have to grip it hard.

The Software (G Hub) is required, and has to be RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND at all times in order for 90% of the mouse's features to work. The mouse claims to have on-board memory but NONE of the settings can be customized with it, you can only use pre-made profiles which all suck. So if you want to change DPI, Polling Rate, or any of the button functions, you need G Hub running at all times.

For folks like me who like to squeeze as much performance from their machines as possible, this is unacceptable. In my task manager right now there are 6 different G Hub .exes using up a total of 246 CPU threads, and an absurd 300mb of RAM. If the mouse had working on-board memory this wouldn't even be worth mentioning, but it doesn't, so it is.

Coming from a G700 (another Logitech mouse) I thought this mouse would be an upgrade, little did I know that my 7 year old mouse was leaps and bounds ahead of this modern brick.
My G700 also needed Logitech software to customize, but it had WORKING ON-BOARD MEMORY, meaning if I wanted to set the DPI and save it to the mouse for use on another PC I could easily do so, with the new G Hub software this is impossible."

Tanvir Salahuddin,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020","*Update* I got a replacement mouse, and after about 5 months of use, it no longer registers left clicks consistently. This is a garbage product, especially since its marketed to the FPS market. I'm unable to play FPS at all anymore; I can hold my button down using an automatic weapon, and it will fire a SINGLE shot. This mouse has been a waste of time, money, and energy. I'm not going to bother trying to get a 3rd mouse. This is a garbage product.

I bought this mouse on March 29 of 2019, and its already having a lot of problems.

I enjoyed it while it worked, but it has slowly stopped doing that.

Sensor and most of the buttons work fine, but the left mouse button is not working properly. It will either register a click, double click, no click, or 'unclick' when holding the button down. Its sorely disappointing after only having it for a year. So far its impeding my workflow and ability to game properly, and Logitech Support has been startlingly unhelpful (its still under warranty).

None of the problems I'm facing are isolated or rare: google search results will tell you as much. Lots of people on tech forums are exacting the same frustrations.

I ordered a Corsair Scimitar Pro to replace this. After 15 years of using Logitech mice, ever since the launch of the gaming brand, with the G5, I've decided to go elsewhere.

If you're mulling this model over: look elsewhere. Its an endemic issue for this particular model."

Justin W.,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2020","The design and ergonomics of this mouse are outstanding. All the buttons are placed perfectly, the freewheeling ability of the scroll wheel makes traversing long web pages or documents incredibly easy. Even the companion software doesn't give me that much to complain about.

But the Chinese Omron switches Logitech puts in this mouse are terrible, and Logitech knows it.

Within two months of my original purchase, I began experiencing the dreaded double click issue, and quickly opened a ticket with Logitech support. To their credit, they were able to quickly send me a replacement with very little fuss.

Now, less than 10 months of only moderate use later, not only has the left click started to intermittently have the double clicking issue, but the mouse 5 button has failed entirely. I have opened another support ticket, and hope to be able to get yet another replacement, but this is unacceptable. They know these switches are bad. Consumers have had to resort to repairing the switches themselves or even buying the higher quality Japanese made Omron switches to drop in as replacements.

If I do get a SECOND replacement (within only the first year of owning this mouse) I will gladly continue to use it until it too starts to display these issues, but I can't in good conscience recommend this mouse to anyone.

sbo,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2023","So, let's just jump into it and say this is without a doubt the least comfortable mouse I've ever used. I have fairly large hands, this mouse clearly isn't built for me.

First of all the body is very narrow, causing my hand to create an uncomfortable arch. Likewise, the primary mouse buttons are also narrow.

The G-shift button (thumb button which changes DPI on the fly) is far to pronounced and made for people with baby thumbs. No matter how I adjust my grip, I continually press it by mistake. I've disable the button via Logitech's software, but the sensation of constantly pressing the button is jarring.

The metal scroll wheel just doesn't feel great on my finger, really wish it was rubberized.

I threw away the box, so unfortunately I'm stuck with this thing. So I figure I might try to shave down the thumb button or maybe epoxy it so it can't be pressed."

The 1 star review for this stems from the Logitech G Hub software, which is needed to make use of most features on the mouse. After installing the software on my computer, windows began randomly crashing with blue screens.

I did some searching and found this to be a known issue that many others have had. I tried uninstalling the G Hub software and windows crashed every time I tried to do that. I ended up restoring windows to a previous backup, but even that didn't fully fix the crashing. I'm now on day 2 of trying to fix up my computer after the damage the Logitech software did, and going to be reinstalling windows. Wish me luck!

M.Demartini,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2019","I bought this mouse to replace the Logitech Performance MX, I had 4 of those in the past two years and they are great until they get the infamous double click issue. I did not want to spend another $99 on that and hopped this mouse would work better.
The good:
- It is a nice looking mouse from outside

The bad:
- Right out of the box, this mouse started randomly double clicking or needed to click multiple times for it to react.
- On free-wheel mode, it just scrolls with the movement of the mouse, even if the wheel is not moving at all.
- Not at all ergonomic, it will hurt your hand after 10 minutes using it. The back is too narrow, no support for the right side of your hand, and to hold it properly you have to close your hand in an awkward way.
- Both options of the software to program/change settings are unnecessarily intrusive on your computer, and every 30 minutes or so, make it go sluggish with the mouse barely responding. If you remove the software the default settings for the buttons are useless.

I have been a loyal Logitech buyer for over 20 years, but the quality of their products has been on a free fall for a while now, and this is the last product I buy from them. The quality of the product no longer justifies the price.

Ive tinkered with it for a few weeks now and still cant get it to to start with the computer. It still periodically freezes and requires a re-install to get it working again.

7/13/21 update: More Ghub issues- freezes and there is an article on how to fix the problem online (so it's a known issue) but it is a tedious process to re-install the proper way (doing a simple add/remove wont work and the error persists) At this point, assuming GHUB is part of all logitech mice, I would avoid Logitech mice all together."

Getting the mouse replaced under warranty, but not holding out hope, as this seems a common problem that gets worse with each mouse over time.

You can have this problem with either the left or right buttons, or both. It will be noticeable when you get false double-clicks (i.e. when you meant to single click).

In my case, had the problem from day 1, but initially thought I was accidentally double clicking & needed to get used to the mouse's button sensitivity. But it got worse over time until it was clearly an issue with the mouse. Logitech support first had me install their ""G Hub"" software and update the firmware of the mouse. This seemed to correct the problem, but only for a couple weeks. This does seem to be something that gradually deteriorates in the switch mechanism of the buttons, and a software fix can only do so much.

There is a website that can detect the fast/false clicks. Logitech warranty support will want a video of you using this website that detects the false/fast clicks. See video I've attached, but note they will want a handheld video where you show the physical mouse in your hand and the website on screen, no edits, etc. (this is fair--they do have to protect themselves from fraudulent warranty claims). Google ""fast double click test"" to find the website. The problem tends to come and go, and the likelihood of getting a fast/false click may depend on exactly how you are holding the mouse at that moment, which changes as you slide the mouse around or just shift your sitting position. For the video here I happened to find a hand position where it was happening most of the time, and carefully kept my hand in that position and pressed the button the same way each time. More often I get around 10 bad clicks out of 100. Sometimes I get zero out of 100.

I'll update this review after some time with the replacement."

I've only used Corsair for about 10 years now and I remember Logitech being a decent company for gaming peripherals...oh how the mighty have fallen. It's extremely cheap plastic, I feel like this thing is going to break in my hands, I found myself treating it like a priceless artifact. The buttons move around and feel and sound so cheap, just that typical cheap plastic sound you get from toys at the Dollar Store. The weights don't fit well inside the mouse, I picked up the mouse to move it and the cheap bottom feel out as well as two weights. I'd had enough of this mouse after a night's worth of gaming when the adhesive at the top used to promote frictionless movement started to peel off and scratch my mouse pad. I immediately had enough, packaged it back up the way it came and started the refund process.

Corsair, if you're reading this, please please please just fix the left click issue and you still have the best gaming mouse on the market.

I am now on my second G502 Hero mouse. Both have the exact same problem where the left mouse button starts double-clicking for any presses after about 3 months of use and therefore holding the mouse button does not work.

Additionally, now that Logitech has reduced capacity due to COVID getting in touch with a person is impossible and the warranty submission and ticket creation systems DO NOT work. Both take me directly back to the product page creating an endless cycle. I also tried the ""Support Bot"" and go to the point where it asked if I wanted to create a ticket, but it just shows a repeated progress meter like it is going to do something and never actually completes.

While not directly related to this issue, I also had a Logitech K810 keyboard fail, which was BEFORE COVID and the device was quickly replaced (when I could actually reach someone); however, it was within a 3 month period of having purchased that product as well.

The first replacement was no hassle - describe issue and sent a new one out.

The second has been a nightmare. I have spent hours jumping through hoops to document the issue even though it's widely publicized. I have gone so far as to recording a video of the issue with the mouse and serial number in the screen and it was still met with disbelief and hassle. I was told that a ticket number, which was not provided, was not in the video. After clearing my desk to have several different attempts at this video, I have attempted to contact supervisors to no avail.

I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years. I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature. The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about. So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in. It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly. So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY. The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews.

Nathan Engle,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2021","Another casualty of war. I purchased this mouse in April 2020 and now it's the end of January 2021. Just under a year old and the double click/click and drag fail has begun. From what I've gathered, it's a well known hardware issue that pertains to the switches. The problem is clicking, holding and dragging. The click releases and then clicks again while dragging. There's been posts of customer's having this problem right out of the box. The only way to resolve it is by ordering different switches, voiding your warranty, and attempting to replace them yourself.

The mouse feels good and the option to add weight is nice but not necessary. I like the RGB and extra buttons but the mouse wheel feels a bit derpy. I did end up getting used to that though. What you can't get used to is the broken primary and secondary buttons releasing while click holding. Someone on Reddit mentioned a macro fix and it has helped many but it has not helped me. This is a hardware issue. I thought maybe it was firmware but no... I have updated and still not working properly. I'm very upset with this and I will be contacting their customer support for a replacement. What an inconvenience. 2 stars for being a beautiful paperweight in one year."

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","When I received the product I was fairly ecstatic about it considering I haven't bought a gaming mouse for quite some time. In the first thirty minutes, having to install g hub and configuring the mouse seemed to be a pain in the rear considering that options and changes I've made weren't functioning correctly and did not fully implement itself into the mouse. Cases of this were changing the functionality of some buttons on the mouse as provided by the software (g hub) and the dpi of the mouse. While these nuances were frustrating and tedious, it did not attract much annoyance and dissatisfaction as it did when

THE MOUSE WOULD PERIODICALLY STOP FUNCTIONING IN MOVEMENT DESPITE OTHER BUTTONS WORKING AS INTENDED

I'm not sure whether this is a shipment issue that damaged the product, which is unlikely considering the package was pristine, or simply a defective product that was sent to me. Either case this should not be an issue when spending $80 on a advertised high quality mouse. Honestly disappointing. Best part of the mouse was the mouse wheel which I had a lot of fun just spinning. The mouse functions and works as best as my 6-8 month old mouse. Buy something cheaper. Probably won't buy from logitech anymore after this purchase."
Starsylph,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2019","Update: The tracking comes and goes. This is extremely disruptive to my gaming. Cannot find any sort of fix. Lowering the review to 1 star.

An hour into using this product, it's tracking has suddenly improved. I do not know if it will remain consistent in this, but until it funks up again, I'm changing my review score to a 3 instead of a 1. If it doesn't mess up at all, I'll be inclined to raise the review to 5 stars.

Unlike their predecessor, the hero version apparently doesn't give the option to turn off surface tuning. This won't affect everyone... but if you have the wrong mousepad, this mouse will not function properly for you, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it, except go buy new mousepads until you get one that works. It will lose tracking frequently on the wrong surface, and the only option is to change the surface you use until you find one it deems suitable.

Edit: 8 months in, the gaming mouse is shot. The left and right buttons won't hold consistently anymore, will have to replace the mouse. If I had larger hands and pressed closer to the far tips of the buttons, it might not be so much of an issue... might. As it is, the mouse is useless to me now."
Amanda N.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2019","So I have a love hate relationship with this mouse. The sensor is great. The feel is great. The mouse overall is everything I want. Now for the bad part. I bought the mouse in july and am on my 3rd mouse. 3 times now because I am not gonna return it again, the main mouse buttons have become glitchy. To the point to where if you dont hold it down with the strength of Hercules, it starts deciding it wants to do this thing where it cant decide to be pushed down or not. So you get this weird sort of on/off super fast. Which being a gaming mouse is horrid. Are you trying to ADS, well i hope you like going in and out of zoom at 400 times a minute. Want to play a shin-obi that needs to block quickly. Eh maybe in half a second when it decides to register the click. This is inexcusable. Once or twice i can maybe understand. But for me to get three mice from logitech that all had the same problem of what I am guessing is the most bottom barrel micro switches for the right and left mouse buttons is ridiculous. So this is a great mouse. For about 3 weeks before it breaks. If you arent a heavy gamer then maybe a week,"
Dean S,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2023","Pros: Great mouse. Wired so no battery or lag. All buttons are configurable and DPI range is great. Weights are configurable for the best feel you want or need.

Cons: Cheap construction. Other mention the double click issues. My mouse's scroll wheel broke. The spring mechanism is no longer existent. When I scroll, the wheel keeps rotating unless I forcibly stop it. Makes youtube/insta/etc unwatchable because it jumps between videos. 6 Months for a wheel to go back is really back considering the price of the mouse.

Edit: Logitech replaced the mouse and the replacement had the scroll wheel break 3 months into it. Had to change from 3 stars to 1 star due to this."
Irish guy,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023","Got this to replace my old mouse that worked absolutely fine but Logitech decided to phase it out so the app won’t recognize it, meaning you can’t remap the buttons…

Getting this mouse working on a Mac is a nightmare, it requires several different downloads none of which are clear on what you need to set up. Their website is blighted with broken links and support threads that go nowhere. You cannot change any setting on the other buttons without downloading 2-4 apps/drivers, and then all those apps demand full unrestricted access to your entire computer which is incredibly intrusive, but you have to or it won’t work at all. Also mine still would not recognize the mouse until I created an account, which seems like it was by design.

Last Logitech device I ever buy."
R Redmon,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023",There is no sense in such bad quality. 6 months ago G-Hub just disappeared from the computer nothing wrong with this computer it just stopped working and could not reinstall. Now the mouse will not adjust the buttons do not function as they did and even the scrolling wheel jumps way to many lines and cannot be adjusted in software or on the mouse it self. A piece of junk waiting to fail..
Byron F,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2024","Just doesn't seem to work right. Randomly stops working correctly, and I don't know why. Super intermittent, and absolutely no good for any sort of gaming.

Likewise, it's kind of small. Gives my hand a little bit of cramping, so if you've got big hands this'll be another reason not to buy."
Amazon Customer #101,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021","This mouse is a major disappointment----
1--The biggest problem is a defective left-click button ---- The button operates randomly and can take anywhere from 1 to 4 clicks to open a program. When I went online to see if the defect was solvable, there were 100s of “Logitech Mouse Button Click Problems” hits. Given the button defect, the mouse is being returned.
2--The new Logitech 9.02 gaming software is a pain in the neck and worked so poorly that I uninstalled it and reverted to a prior version of the software that is far more user-friendly.
3--The mouse wheel has a slippery graphite feel, which is somewhat surprising for a mouse built for exact mouse movement.
4--The “user documentation” that came with the mouse was limited to a few small stick figures with text so small that I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it. The mouse did come with a large G decal and a fancy, but useless, color promo flyer---- I suspect that most users would prefer that you dump the flyer and decal and devote more focus to a decent instruction sheet."
John A Grabowski,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2022","I used to own the Logitech G500 which is a GREAT mouse. They don't sell that one anymore so I bought this cause it was affordable and I figured it'd be of similar quality. Same company, similar product names etc.

Well out of the box I can say it was great. Fits my hand well(YMMV), good responsive controls, nice LEDs, customizable weights.

It works great for gaming both RTS and FPS.

But the problems started arise today while I was playing Hell Let Loose. My cursor(reticle) was jiggling around about an inch or more on a 27 inch screen periodically.

And the left mouse button would activate without me even touching it seemingly at random.

It hasn't stopped all day so I'm definitely disappointed with this product.

If I find out a solution I'll update this review with more info."
Stephen,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2019","This was a replacement for an older Logitech wireless gaming mouse that's no longer available. I have been buying Logitech products since the company started in the 1980s and have owned many Logitech mice. I purchased this in October of 2019 as an upgrade to an older Logitech G700 which is no longer available. I initially liked the mouse. It has good set of features and I liked the overall design, however after a couple of months I began to have problems with intermittent operation of the right mouse button. At times, when I held down the button it would send random click up and down events. If I pressed harder they would often stop so it was obvious that the switch was malfunctioning. I contacted Logitech and after troubleshooting the problem they sent me a replacement mouse. Over the last couple of weeks the replacement has begun to exhibit the same problem. A quick internet search reveals that this seems to have been a common problem with this model since its release which Logitech has not fixed despite a large number of complaints.. At this point it seems like a waste of time to request another replacement since it seems like;y that it too will fail. I will think twice before purchasing another Logitech product in the future."
Jeremy L. Johnston,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2020","I had this mouse for about a year and some change, and I loved it. Absolutely loved. Unfortunately, the left mouse button started double clicking when I was single clicking or attempting to click and drag. This made work and gaming impossible (double clicking an item in the game I play is a different action than single clicking), so I figured I'd replace it.

I bought the same brand as a replacement because I loved the mouse so much, and it had such a great review score so I figured it was a one-off fluke. Within 2 months the new mouse had the same issue. It was only then that I read the one star reviews and noticed how frequent this issue is.

I am only writing this review in an attempt to help the amazon review reach a more realistic score for such a flawed product. If it had happened once I would have thought it me being unlucky. But two of the same mouse had the same issue in such a short amount of time. Now, I am looking at new mice again, and will be forced to switch brands."
Hanna,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2022","I don't understand it? Sure it has like, some extra buttons but they don't do anything. All you can do is bind them to existing keyboard buttons. You could do that for every game you play I guess, and switch between the profiles for each game. Who has time for that. Are you kidding what a piece of hot garbage. I thought I'd be getting EXTRA BUTTONS, not like, an extension for keyboard buttons. That's not really helpful. I really just don't get it. It's a piece of trash with useless extra buttons. I bought a logitech keyboard like this once years ago and it was just like this. It had a bunch of ""g"" buttons that don't do anything except glow and look cool. Wow. That's awesome. I guess I'm just not enough of a turbo sperg gamer to figure this out."
M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023","This is the second time I've fallen for one of these stupid, shiny Logitech gaming mice. The first one, the original G model, was unusably sensitive and couldn't be adjusted. The G5 has now stopped working after six months. Get a $15 notebook mouse from a big box store. It's a better investment. No more Logitech G mice for me unless it's free."
Allie,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2021","I just wanted a simple mouse for a cheap price but I guess you get what you pay for. I’ve had good luck with Logitech products in the past so I figured this mouse would be decent. There’s not a lot of good, long-lasting gaming mice on the market anymore and I was worried about spending too much just to have them stop working in a couple months.

This one was great at first and appeared to work just right, and didn’t give me the dreaded double-click issue I had with previous gaming mice but after a month, the cursor started to do its own thing. It would randomly drag itself across the screen and freeze and I’d have to unplug and re-plug-in the mouse to my computer in order for it to start up again. Super annoying after the first two or three times and it began doing it more often as time went on. I thought it was a computer issue but it did the same thing on other devices. I ended up getting a different mouse recently. This one is not worth buying."
MAn River,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2020","I still have my MX518 from 15 years ago and the only think that has gone bad is the cable, which I easily replaced with a quick search online. I just wanted a nice upgrade as I still own the MX (and going strong) This piece of junk started to malfunction barely before the year mark (supposedly they use omnron switches marketed for a gazillion actuation life). I am a casual gamer and the only one who uses my computer is me, so I know the device was not abused in any way or form.

Logitech support is a joke. After wasting 2 hours trying to have a representative online, they were not able to process my RMA because their ""system"" was not able to process my serial number. So no, they just gave me a phone number. I called the phone number and it was a labyrinth of menus until finally I was able to reach the correct team. Waited and waited until I hung up exactly 15 minutes after no one replied. Take my advice and don't waste your hard earn money in a company that can't stand behind their products. The mouse went directly into the trash bin."
