Craig R. Maefs,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","I have half a dozen mice. Most are very light and flimsy. They lack any mass and because of that, exact control suffers. The Logitech with customizable weight solves all those problems. It is very solid with great click feel for the buttons. It also feels like the buttons will last longer because the others were so weak, I like this mouse very much."

Kimberly,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2024","TLDR - Thought the mouse would be crap, but it wasnt. Buy it!

My current mouse was super worn out and was missing pieces and in general was looking pretty run down. Which makes sense, its about 5 years old. Since it had lasted so long and I generally like the way it feels I wanted to repurchase the same one. I saw this refurbished one for a bit cheaper than the original. Anything refurbished makes me skeptical that it will be as good as brand new. However I cant pass up on a deal. So i took the risk and bought it. So far it has preformed exactly the same as the original, with the exception that the cable is a rubber cable instead of a braded cable. But honestly I don't really mind."

Hunter Barnett,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2022","I have probably 5 or 6 of these now. Not because they go bad, but because I buy them for others. The app can be annoying when it updates, but it's super simple to use and apply macros to the side buttons. For work I use the top two on the left to Zoom in and out of PDFs, and also to add and remove lines in excel. I use the two sides of the scroll wheel for copy / paste, and have changed the DPI / profile switch(er) to be my print button.

The only issue I've had is my home (gaming) mouse that I bought 2nd hand 3 years ago is starting to double click on the right mouse button. It could just be dirty, but I haven't had it happen continuously, just off and on at random times in game (maybe just double clicking due to input lag of the game) Even for day to day use, I love the ergonomics of this.

Nate,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","I've been using a Performance MX since 2014, and finally decided to upgrade. I split my computer time between programming and gaming, so I was used to having a pretty heavy mouse. I put all of the weights in when I got this and it feels just like my old mouse. The G502 has way more buttons than my old Performance MX, which is great for keymapping on games. I don't personally like high DPI, since I don't play a lot of FPS games, but the DPI has a variable range that's good for just about anything. The glowing G logo is customizable within the Logitech software, as are the button mappings. Great mouse all around"

Chris Hacking,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2019","Refurb quality: only very minor scuffs on the pads, nothing that would catch or looked well-worn. Buttons and hand rests are clean and the buttons and wheel move and click smoothly. The hand rests are actually impressively clean given that their texture seems likely to make it hard to truly clean them.

Product quality: Bought this to replace a cheap gaming mouse I'd had before, which developed issues in months. I'm a little leery of Logitech's reliability (a couple past mice developed various problems), but so far it's been a great purchase. I love the ability to toggle between clicky and free-spin on the wheel, they assortment of buttons, the sensitivity, the adjustable weight, and the look. The software is also quite good. Ergonomics-wise, I wish the mouse was a little bigger - I have big hands, so this won't be a problem for most people - because it's a slightly awkward tradeoff between being able to hold the mouse comfortably and being able to reach even most of the buttons comfortably. Overall, though, it's a great mouse for gaming, productivity, and general computer use, and the price is very good for a mouse of this design."
Jesus Lopez,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",Love this mouse and the customizability of the buttons. Bought forever ago and has held up daily use in gaming and daily work tasks. Love it and will be buying the wireless version of this when it dies.
Mom Branding - Free Products & Rewards,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023","Got a pretty good deal on this, about $35 for an example with ""Refurbished - Excellent Condition"". Refurbished items can be hit or miss but excellent condition is quite accurate this time around!

The mouse feels brand new, the bearings on the scroll wheel are super smooth, it came with a brand new set of weights and a simple manual. NOT in the original box, but I personally don't care. Definitely happy with the order."
Bakins,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023",This is a great mouse! The super scroll feature allows me to scroll through code super fast. 1 flick of the scroll wheel and you can be a thousand lines down. This can be turned on/off with a switch behind the scroll wheel. All buttons are programmable for gaming or applications. Highly recommend!
Amanda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023","This is my first nice mouse and I don't think I can ever go back now to what I was using before.
Many of my friends reccomended this mouse to me. I'm even thinking of getting the wireless variant one day!"
David Samudio,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2022","I got three G502 in total, all refurbished. I highly recommend you get them from the vendor CrownProducts. The quality from my first unit to my second unit was abysmal, with lousy switches, and rattly buttons. I noticed the vendors were different, so I returned the mediocre one and got the rest from the first vendor. All the mice I got from CrownProducts are in excellent condition.

You may receive lame mice as other reviewers are complaining about depending on the seller. Please share good vendors in your reviews =)"
doc,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",I bought my second and received it today. This is a very durable mouse My first I had 7 yrs with a ton of intense gaming hrs on it. I had to replace it with the hero version. The weight system is good for me because I have bad shaky hands and the weight helps stabilize.
jim,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022","Very good mouse, feels good in your hand. I have a large hand and have no problem with it. Depending on what you lit it comes with weight to give you the desired weight and feel. The mouse has on the fly dpi adjustments. You can also download the software to configure the mouse buttons and default dpi. I would buy again!"
Santiago zuñiga,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023","el pedido llego antes de lo previsto (mejor xd)

GTX,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2022","I'm a guy with, I suppose, large guy hands? I dunno, but either way, the thumb rest area feels a bit small, and the mouse overall feels a little small. That said, it's still quite comfortable even for long video editing or gaming sessions. Responsiveness is perfectly fine (on a gaming mat) and there are no issues with how it responds on the computer.

Logitech has always served me well for many years with quality and durability.

It's a nice wired mouse. Not sure what more you want out of this review. XD"
J. L. Waters,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022","The 'renewed' price made this an even better value. I have been a using no-brand gaming mouse, which worked fine for years, but I left it in the studio. This Logitech has better resolution and an even lower price. Now the only limit to selecting a passage in my music editor is the software. I never have to worry about jerky response or hand jitters affecting my accuracy. Works great, love the price."
Sheyleen,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023",It’s good and cool pretty easy to handle
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019","This mouse is by far the best I have ever owned or used. It glides with no resistance and the included weight set helps make the perfect feel.
A button on top selects the dpi and RGB color cycle of the 'G' located at the palm. If the length were just a 'tad' shorter, it would be a 10/10 for my small hands. That being said, I am VERY happy with my purchase.

On a side note, it came very poorly packaged. Mine came renewed, so it came in an odd weak box which is fine, but it was shipped in a soft plastic type envelope (like small items usually ship in). Enviablely, the box got crushed. I was certain the mouse was damaged, but much to my surprise, it was fine. Over all, it's the best mouse with the best feel and ergonomics that looks galactic. I love it."

The software is a little finicky sometimes (at least in my case)

It only happens occasionally, but sometimes Logitech G hub wont detect my mouse. I need to completely uninstall and reinstall the drivers, its happened twice in the last 4 months but this is a software issue, not a product issue.

The mouse is ergonomic, the sensor is amazing, the remappable controls are awesome."

I'm a little leery of Logitech's reliability (a couple past mice developed various problems), but so far it's been a great purchase. I love the ability to toggle between clicky and free-spin on the wheel, they assortment of buttons, the sensitivity, the adjustable weight, and the look. The software is also quite good. Ergonomics-wise, I wish the mouse was a little bigger - I have big hands, so this won't be a problem for most people - because it's a slightly awkward tradeoff between being able to hold the mouse comfortably and being able to reach even most of the buttons comfortably. Overall, though, it's a great mouse for gaming, productivity, and general computer use, and the price is very good for a mouse of this design."
Jesus Lopez,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",Love this mouse and the customizability of the buttons. Bought forever ago and has held up daily use in gaming and daily work tasks. Love it and will be buying the wireless version of this when it dies.
Mom Branding - Free Products & Rewards,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023","Got a pretty good deal on this, about $35 for an example with ""Refurbished - Excellent Condition"". Refurbished items can be hit or miss but excellent condition is quite accurate this time around!

The mouse feels brand new, the bearings on the scroll wheel are super smooth, it came with a brand new set of weights and a simple manual. NOT in the original box, but I personally don't care. Definitely happy with the order."
Bakins,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2023",This is a great mouse! The super scroll feature allows me to scroll through code super fast. 1 flick of the scroll wheel and you can be a thousand lines down. This can be turned on/off with a switch behind the scroll wheel. All buttons are programmable for gaming or applications. Highly recommend!
Amanda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2023","This is my first nice mouse and I don't think I can ever go back now to what I was using before.
Many of my friends reccomended this mouse to me. I'm even thinking of getting the wireless variant one day!"
David Samudio,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2022","I got three G502 in total, all refurbished. I highly recommend you get them from the vendor CrownProducts. The quality from my first unit to my second unit was abysmal, with lousy switches, and rattly buttons. I noticed the vendors were different, so I returned the mediocre one and got the rest from the first vendor. All the mice I got from CrownProducts are in excellent condition.

You may receive lame mice as other reviewers are complaining about depending on the seller. Please share good vendors in your reviews =)"
doc,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",I bought my second and received it today. This is a very durable mouse My first I had 7 yrs with a ton of intense gaming hrs on it. I had to replace it with the hero version. The weight system is good for me because I have bad shaky hands and the weight helps stabilize.
jim,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022","Very good mouse, feels good in your hand. I have a large hand and have no problem with it. Depending on what you lit it comes with weight to give you the desired weight and feel. The mouse has on the fly dpi adjustments. You can also download the software to configure the mouse buttons and default dpi. I would buy again!"
Santiago zuñiga,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023","el pedido llego antes de lo previsto (mejor xd)
llego en el mejor estado posible y funciona superbien, a pasado una semana desde la entrega aun no se puede asegurar la duracion del producto con respento al tiempo."
GTX,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2022","I'm a guy with, I suppose, large guy hands? I dunno, but either way, the thumb rest area feels a bit small, and the mouse overall feels a little small. That said, it's still quite comfortable even for long video editing or gaming sessions. Responsiveness is perfectly fine (on a gaming mat) and there are no issues with how it responds on the computer.

Logitech has always served me well for many years with quality and durability.

It's a nice wired mouse. Not sure what more you want out of this review. XD"
J. L. Waters,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022","The 'renewed' price made this an even better value. I have been a using no-brand gaming mouse, which worked fine for years, but I left it in the studio. This Logitech has better resolution and an even lower price. Now the only limit to selecting a passage in my music editor is the software. I never have to worry about jerky response or hand jitters affecting my accuracy. Works great, love the price."
Sheyleen,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2023",It’s good and cool pretty easy to handle
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2019","This mouse is by far the best I have ever owned or used. It glides with no resistance and the included weight set helps make the perfect feel.
A button on top selects the dpi and RGB color cycle of the 'G' located at the palm. If the length were just a 'tad' shorter, it would be a 10/10 for my small hands. That being said, I am VERY happy with my purchase.

On a side note, it came very poorly packaged. Mine came renewed, so it came in an odd weak box which is fine, but it was shipped in a soft plastic type envelope (like small items usually ship in). Enviablely, the box got crushed. I was certain the mouse was damaged, but much to my surprise, it was fine. Over all, it's the best mouse with the best feel and ergonomics that looks galactic. I love it."

Michael Cox,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2022","Second one of these I have purchased. Original fell victim to a ""food related incident."" I purchased a second to fill the void, and the first miraculously recovered after a thorough cleaning with ribbing alcohol and Clorox wipes. My son now has the original, several months strong, and I'll buy another to replace this when it eventually goes off (original was owned for 3 years prior to incident)"

Dirty Stan,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019","I love my G502.

The software is a little finicky sometimes (at least in my case)

It only happens occasionally, but sometimes Logitech G hub wont detect my mouse. I need to completely uninstall and reinstall the drivers, its happened twice in the last 4 months but this is a software issue, not a product issue.

The mouse is ergonomic, the sensor is amazing, the remappable controls are awesome."
Daniel G.,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2021","So overall, the mouse sensor, buttons, cable, and feel of it are all as portrayed. It came in a bit dirty but I gave it a good clean and it looks amazing. What a deal m8 :))))"

Jp gibbs,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2019","This mouse is already heavy and comes with extra weights but whateva. The grips on this mouse after a year or so, kinda peel and collect dirt and it gets gross if you don't clean regularly. All the buttons are fine and the scroll wheel is awesome. Use G-Hub to change keybinds and colors/patterns. Good to pair with the Logitech Pro Keyboard."
