Along with the double click issue, I now also have the holding click not working issue, so the clicker on this sucker is apparently nearing its end. Sometimes can't drag a window or content as it stops the click press. You can know you have this issue because the mouse has a click sound both when pressed and depressed, so if it stops dragging and then you release the click, you hear the sound. What a waste. Good while it worked. No more expensive Logitech stuff for me.

Updated: Less than a year in
I finally started experiencing the dreaded double click when single clicking. It happens just enough to cause me grief at times. Definitely my last Logitech mouse as they seem very prone to this. After spending $$ on the mouse and wireless pad, this mouse ended up costing a good chunk to not even last a year. I do like the comfort with the wireless. Buyer beware.

Updated: 5 months later
While this mouse is about the same as all Logitech mice I've ever owned (more than I can recall), it ends up about the same as every one of them. It is extremely prone to gathering crude on the bottom side of the mouse. More so than any others I've owned (Razer, Steel, several other brands). It is as if they think the underside of the mouse should be pretty, with different designs and indents. My cat likes to use my mouse pad as her resting spot and dogs are flying around with plenty of hair in the breeze. I think about all of it collects under this mouse better than my air purifier. I'm constantly having to clean it since it grabs everything due to poor underside smoothness. Maybe if I used it in a sterile environment?

Otherwise, the charging, along with Logitech's charge pad, has been working great. It stays charged between 85 and 95%. I worked around the changing DPI when the mouse sleeps by setting up an offline profile on the mouse that matched my normal DPI usage. Then turned off the offline mode. It appears that when the mouse sleeps, it defaults to the offline DPI, so you get that pause of difference each time you start using the mouse.

Probably my last attempt with Logitech. I'll probably try replacing the feet and maybe just smearing some silicon across the bottom parts to see if I can reduce it's pickup of hair and stuff.

Original:
I've owned too many Logitech mice to count over the years - other G502 models, G500 and on. For many years, the G500 was my go to. I think they stopped making it because, well, you apparently just have to keep changing things so you can market something different. At any rate, my last G502 Proteus suffered the same fate of many mice today where the clicker stopped functioning correctly, which of course kind of defeats the purpose of the mouse. This G502 Lightspeed is basically the same mouse as far as I can tell. Maybe a little better tracking, although I never had issues with mice that did half what the advertised tracking is today on these.

I had switched over and tried Razor, Steel and a few other with little to no success. They were either made of cheap parts (plastic/glue that eventually smudged all over) or had similar click issue. Since no company seems capable of producing quality products in 2021, I went back to Logitech.

If you like a bigger size mouse that has weight to it, this is your mouse. After trying other mice that were smaller and 2/3 of less the weight of this mouse, I realized that long term use of a small, light mouse isn't for me. My hand would cramp and my forearm would ache. I also missed the thumb holder of all things.

There are still some flaws in the design of this mouse. I don't know what kind of thumb you should be born with to use all the buttons correctly. If you palm the mouse, you need a thumb long as a finger to easily reach the front thumb buttons. If you claw grip, you need to bend your thumb backwards since you're over shooting the back buttons. You get used to shifting your hand around on it, although it makes for awkward motion and unsteady handling of the mouse when you're trying to be precise. The other buttons are about what you'd expect - feel the same as any other Logitech mouse I've owned.

The mouse wheel is a mixed bag. I like the grip they used on it as other mice often have some texture that doesn't feel that good for the finger. You can switch from free spin to the notched spin where you get tactical feel as you scroll. The free spin is nice, although it's a little too free. I thought I remembered prior versions not being as loose. In any software where you could go scroll happy, the free spin may spin when you don't expect it to or you can accidentally spin a bit as you reposition your fingers for that dang thumb button. I've ended up keep the tactical feel spin set, which is ok.

Given it's a wireless mouse, I opted for the PowerPlay wireless pad to go with it. The downside, if you like a really heavy mouse, is that in order to work with PowerPlay, you have to take the weights out for the charging battery. That seems like yet another big oversight. I personally don't need the weights in it, so it didn't bother me one way or the other.

Without PowerPlay and the lights turned off, I was getting around 60 to 80 hours of charge. Kind of an odd range, although I'm guessing it just depended on how long it sat there in sleep mode when I wasn't using it. With the LEDs turned on, that dropped down closer to 30 to 40 hours. That's still pretty good. I'm not sure why you have lights on a mouse to begin with because, well, your hand is generally on it and you can't see those lights. I guess if you want fancy lights when you're not at your desk, it works ok.

With PowerPlay, the mouse stays charged and I seem to stay somewhere between 80 and 90% charge almost always. It appears to drain down and then charge up a bit to not wear out the battery. The two devices together are exactly what I was hoping for - a wireless mouse that didn't have a cord dragging around and a charger that didn't require me to remember to charge up every time I turned around. I'd highly recommend the pad to go with this.

One fault I've had with most Logitech and other brands is the textured grips and especially the multiple designs on the bottom of the mice. All those indentations are dirt magnets. Sure, they look nice. Maybe they add to the handling of the mouse in some small degree. Maybe it looks nicer than a smooth, plain surface. I'd gladly trade whatever advantages for a completely smooth, easy to clean mouse though. My cat thinks my mouse pad is a bed and the mouse itself a pillow, so I constantly have hair and just whatever body oils come off my hands onto the mouse over time. Cleaning is such a pain and when any hair or residue gets on the under side of the mouse, you'll notice it tracking oddly. I'm not a slob by any means - I'd have issues here regardless of wild vermin roaming the house.

Lastly is the software. Everything you have anymore wants to install some crap in your system tray. And from what I can tell, that software is what reminds your mouse what DPI you have it set to. So while the software works ok and I've not crashed or seen any issues out of it, the one thing that I have noticed is that the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes and soon as you start moving it instantly wakes up. There is a bit of lag between when the mouse wakes and the software sees it back alive. So the mouse is working instantly, although the DPI of the mouse is the factory default and not the custom setting. So there's this short bit of time where your DPI isn't what you think it is. Once the software realizes the mouse is awake, it tells it to change and things are good once again. Just annoying that they don't appear to save the settings on the mouse itself. Setup is a bit confusing at times with all the options, so I could have missed it.

Overall, the mouse works just like I expected. I was a little disappointed that this was almost a clone to the mouse I owned 5 or 6 years, although I like that mouse a lot, so that's ok. I'm pretty sure the wheel may be a little bit of downgrade and the sound of the clicks is a bit loud compared to some. It is very comfortable though and it felt like coming home after a couple days use. Being wireless, I'm about as happy as I could probably be, so I'd recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a wireless, heavier side, large mouse."
Mike,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","I'm trying really hard to like this mouse, I really am. I like its ergonomics, its features, and even the programmable macro buttons.

This is now the second time I've re-written this review because I was trying to be fair, but the connectivity for the mouse is just so bad, that I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone. Intermittently, the mouse will lose connection and try to 'interpolate' where the cursor should be based on the last direction it was moving. This results in very choppy movement even on low report rate. This has been happening on multiple computers with different Operating Systems (Windows 10, 11, Linux.) I tried numerous solutions around the internet, Such as:

*Cleaning the sensor
*Trying different mouse pads and surfaces
*Reinstalling Logitech's driver software
*Uninstalling the Logitech Drivers and using the onboard memory manager program instead
*Lowering the report rate down to 125Hz
*Used an extension cable to bring the receiver closer to the mouse, to a point it doesn't make sense to be wireless anymore.

I've even forgone the wireless aspect and connected it physically via USB Micro (Yes, this mouse which costs a hundred dollars in 2024, still uses USB Micro instead of C.) And the way Logitech engineers made this mouse, its annoying to try and connect physically. Sure, you may have a couple USB Micro cables still laying around, but do you have one that's thin enough? Because the female connection for USB Micro is so recessed into a narrow inset, most cables you have are probably too wide to fit in the inset. Sure, you can use the included cable but in my case it stopped working after 2 months of use. No clue why it had to be engineered this way, because I've used both an MX Master 2, and 3 and never had this design flaw.

None of these attempted solutions alleviated the fact my mouse has intermittent connection issues. I had a Logitech G604 wireless mouse and that too had the same problem: Intermittent choppy movement. I'm not sure whats going on at Logitech, but reading around online on forums, I'm not the only person having such an issue. It feels like the quality is going down, since this is the second mouse I've bought from Logi that costs over a hundred dollars, that ended up being unusable. And at this stage, its looking like I'm not going to be a returning customer.

Stay away like its the plague."
BC,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","TLDR: This is a great mouse that is ruined by bad switches

I have been waiting for the wireless version of this mouse for years, since the original came out. I was a bit put off by the price but when my MX Revolution finally broke beyond my ability to repair it, I decided to buy this.

At first I was a bit let down, I wasn't really used to a light mouse and I mistook that as a sign of poor quality. It took a couple days for me to really start to enjoy using it and after that I was hooked. It has the perfect shape for my hand, the button arrangement is easy for me to use and the lack of weight makes it very easy to move quickly or lift up to reposition without straining to keep a grip on it. The only thing I changed early on was to use some grip tape on the main buttons so I had more control. The battery life is good, it lasts longer than my MX battery did so I have no complaints about that. G-Hub is required to use it but once you have everything set up the way you want, you can store the settings to the mouse and uninstall it if it bothers you that much, I came from Setpoint so G-Hub doesn't seem that bad.

So why the 1 star review after all this good ? The switches, within 2 weeks of owning this mouse I was getting double clicks on the left mouse button, it started with just one every once and awhile but then it started to happen more and more often, at first I thought (hoped) it was the grip tape I added, so I removed it, no change. I did find that I could get it to work normally if I pressed down hard and held the mouse button for a bit longer than I normally would but that just isn't something I was willing to do every time. So I came here thinking I would exchange it for a new one but they are out of stock. Between that and the fact that I really like so much about this mouse I decided to fix it myself and keep it. I bought some Kaith red micro switches and replaced the two main mouse switches with them. This worked great and I now have a perfect mouse, but I shouldn't need to fix a new product. If I was the only person who had this experience I would chalk it up to one bad product out of millions and still give it a good review but so many others have the same double click issues that this is obviously a QC issue that needs to be resolved. Logitech, if you read this, please, please fix this issue. You have an amazing product that is being ruined by a couple of $.50 switches.

To anyone else having this issue, if you want to go the same route I went just search ""G502 Lightspeed Full Teardown / Switch Replacement"" and there is a Reddit post that walks you through what to do with pics, it's really very easy if you know how to solder. If anyone has any questions just ask here and I will be happy to add any info that is needed."
Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I've been a loyal Logitech buyer since mx518, but I can't anymore. This is now the 4th Logi mouse I've had with bad switches within 2 years, and now the sensor is going bad. It has been about 1 year of use on this one. I'm not RMA'ing these anymore, I'd just rather purchase something that is reliable.

There are some baffling quality choices they've made on these. Not only in the switches that seem to have an abhorrent fail rate, but in just the quality. I realize now that I've gotten an equivalent replacement from another brand how much actual garbage is here. The feet are baffling. they are the thickness and flexibility of electric tape. I use a hard mat and they started folding over within months. The one around the sensor has a gap. since this is also recessed a bit (not the case on the new different-brand mouse) it's like it's begging to collect the most garbage possible. Which made the initial sensor issues so frustrating to figure out until it got overt. I couldn't tell if a random hair or something just got in there. It also makes an audible loose shake when you move it quickly right out of the box. That just feels and sounds bad. The switches all have a squishy actuation to them that feel imprecise.

I have large hands, so even though the size feels ok, the placement of the dpi switches are impossible to not smash mid-match at key times. mileage may vary there.

I had a lot of people recommend the 502 after the other high-end logi models I had already replaced. So the seem popular. But this was my last try with Logitech. I don't know how you charge this much for hardware like this.

Also of mention: the software, G-hub, though it looked fine, was functionally kind of a nightmare. and especially with other Logi peripherals. before replacing this, support had put forth that maybe closing the mouse's own software while running games would stop the sensor issue. that was actually the exact point where I just laughed, pulled up an amazon tab and bought a different brand. and so far, that was a fantastic decision."
Thomas Cederlof,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I'm so sick of people praising Logitech support. They are so SO bad at their customer support. Which is a shame, because usually their physical product is good but half the time there's is some small flaw that causes their products (whether it's mouse, keyboard or headset). Wouldn't be as much of a problem if it happens within the first 30 days through Amazon to get a replacement. But the minute you have to go through the Logitech Customer Support just consider yourself screwed (you ain't getting a replacement back). Their website and customer support is so backwards and convoluted it's almost like it's on purpose. It worked okay when I first bought, then as soon as I can't do an Amazon return, *POOF* it just fails to connect or turn on. Then you refer to their official FAQ, Reddit and random Google searches to troubleshoot. Nothing works. So you try to create a ticket, you tell them that you tried everything multiple times with nothing fixing it, yet Logitech Customer Support websites keep requiring you to login, then they refer you to the FAQ like 100 times, then to a AI chatbot where you have to say ""NOT HELPFUL"" to every same ""solution"" you've already read and tried 100 times. Then when you get a ""live chat agent"", they ask the SAME QUESTIONS, AGAIN, but spanned out over a 45 minute time waste. Then they say ""Give us your Name and Address, we will create a ticket number and email you. Then you get the email, with no information other then a ticket number they tell you refer but it literally doesn't exist on your account options or anything on their website. So you reply to the email and say just link me to the ticket, and their response is the LITERAL exact email that your responding too, but piled on that is them asking to refer to the FAQ and asking for your Name and address yet again as if they just didn't save that information. Do this over a few months and its like great, I've already done this 5-10 in this weird feed back loop when getting assistance can be easily done one time. Logitech SUCKS. Out of $115. These people suck so bad at customer support, so yeah if someone tells you that Logitech Support is good, they are dumb or lying. Keep that in mind."

When it comes to the Logitech Program... its annoying AF.

Update:
12/5/2019

The double-clicking has gotten really noticeable. Not bad enough it affects me in FPS games cause I am just shootings. I do notice it when using google and I double click things. Happens 1/20 or sometimes more or less. Its sad the mouse is not as good as the wired version. I have 5 of the wired versions for my desktop, laptop, traveling, work, and at my other home. The mouse otherwise is great other than sometimes it losing the profile I am on or not being detected in the GHUB which is a GHUB issue and always has been unless you use wired. I take that back cause it has even lost my speakers and my keyboard that is wired. The GHUB program is a terrible man. I wouldn't use it but for the G502 Light Speed you cant use the old software that is simple and has no issues. I have thought about switching back to the old wired G502 and gaming back to the old program, but I will wait until I get the point where I can't stand the double-clicking. Most other games from FPS I normally use a controller for RPG, sports, or racing games. GHUB is terrible. Don't even get me started about that stupid program or just google all the issues people have had with it. I once had to reformat my computer to get it uninstalled so I could reinstall it to get it to update because the update froze as it does for a lot of people and the ways to fix it were not working like normal. I would not use this mouse. The price is high but so are all really nice things and the double-clicking and software which I think is the worse part I would not buy right now."
Tim Bohrer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Mouse jumps around a lot, it is easily the best mouse I have ever had. Yet, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. If you are moving the mouse even if you aren't touching the scroll wheel it will jump around and move on its own. Kinda insane because you can't scroll through webpages, or play games that utilize the mouse wheel. The worst part is that there isn't a fix for it other than ""firmware update"" which I am up to date.

Seems simple enough to program the mouse to ignore oposite rolling unless rolling for more than 2 or 3 clicks or what ever... Seems even easier to give the custom program a sliding scale for sensitivity for the mouse, or any other mouse out there.

I spent a lot extra and have the wireless charging pad and got this mouse to go with it. Ugh, what a pain in the butt."
bahmtoll,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I would've given 0 Star if I could've.

I originally had G502 Hero (Wired) I liked it, so I ordered wireless one G502 Lightspeed with 25K HERO sensor.
When i received, I read the box since there are two different model for G502 Lightspeed.
One is old model with 16K sensor, newer model is with 25K sensor.
But on the box says 16K sensor. So checked the model number and serial number under the bottom cover of the mouse. It was shocking.

1) First, the number on the box were stickers covered original one. (I am not sure if the original one comes like that since i did not take it off. I needed to return.

2) The model number on the mouse was 810-006427 which was old model.
(Newer model number should be 910-005565)
The model number on the box has the newer model number.

3) I also checked serial number, the number on the box and the number on the bottom of the mouse did not match either.

I contacted AMAZON, and they said they were sorry and made the replacement taking 2 more days, guess what ?
The same thing happened.

And additionally, the replacement looks like it was used - checked the skid pad under the mouse.
The plastic cover was not in the correct way and skid pad was not fresh.
How can this happen with plastic sealed product ?

The Product Number and the serial number on the box were stickers. I don't know actual product was made like that. But what I know is they came with plastic covers which were sealed.

At this point, I don't know what to do. returning and getting a replacement will make the same thing happen again for sure because AMAZON will not be able to open the box before shipping to check.
even if they do, that means I am going to receive opened box.

The worst experience ever."
Vladislav,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I bought two of these for $163 each, and I just had to throw away mine. Yes, it lasted for about 4-5 years or so, but it's not enough when a mouse costs like three very good mice. I had to replace my older top-end Logitech mouse for the exact same reason. They've known about the issue, but they wouldn't start using different switches. It makes them money at the end of the day. Reviewers never mention this in video reviews either because they get paid, so you'll find out about it later. I'd recommend going for the cheaper version for $40. It's the ""G502 HERO"" wired version. It's WAY worth $40. The mouse is amazing.

I have to say this Hero sensor is the best sensor I've ever seen in a mouse. The mouse is amazing in all other aspects. The movement is precise, and I definitely started enjoying FPS games way more. You always feel in control, and aiming is just so much fun."

M. Chase Masters,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","Logitech's higher end mice: G903 Lightspeed and the G502 Lightspeed have a common problem: double-clicking. Over a short period of time, it can get very aggravating.

So I put in a ticket on Logitech's site (which that alone is confusing) and days later I receive canned emails asking me to go through endless troubleshooting steps, which I did. Days later I received an email asking me to record videos with my smartphone camera of the mouse, it's serial number, and a handwritten note with the case number, provide a copy of my receipt, record another video of their ""double click"" test and upload all of this to a Google Drive folder and provide them the link to it.

I do all this. I then receive an email from their technical support telling me they need to inspect my mouse. So after all that, they want me to stick the mouse in a box and ship it to them. Of course, this is simply to try and wear you out, so you give up.

Take my word for it, if you are a gamer do not buy these mice. I'd suggest the Razer mice that come with their optical switches. They last longer than Logitech's mechanical, and they are also less prone to Logitech's double-clicking nightmares."

It's amazing to use with the powerplay mouse pad and have a wireless mouse that never has to be recharged. However, there has been a recurring theme with these mice and that is the infamous double click issue. Before my G502, I had a G900 that I had for a couple years that never experienced this issue. I eventually had to replace that one though because the battery stopped holding a charge. I then got the G903, theoretically the same identical mouse but also supported the then new powerplay mousepad. Well, I went through THREE of them and they all started producing a double click issue after only a couple months after purchase. I thought maybe there was something wrong with that model so I ended up purchasing the G502. Well, I bought it back in March and it's only July and guess what? Double-clicking issue is showing up already. Logitech, you make great products, but this double click issue is now in so many of your mice that I can no longer recommend your brand to my friends and I can no longer trust Logitech peripherals. Even if it wasn't for the switch issue, the software you created, Logitech G Hub, is the most atrocious piece of software I have ever used. It seemingly only wants to work half the time with most of the time it just failing to launch without a complete uninstall and reinstall.

But I shouldn’t have to *think* and *work* to get my mouse to do what it’s supposed to do. Save your time and money like I wish I did."
Jacob Smith,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","The mouse itself seems to be a great product, but the accompanying app, Logitech G-Hub, which you use to customize the mouse itself and the button layout, is an absolute nightmare. It is confusing, frustrating, and is not user friendly. It automatically switches profiles without your consent, which is annoying if you want to have a personalized profile while playing a game. Maybe there is something that I am missing, but the G-Hub has no tutorial, and after hours of trying to figure it out and searching the web for help, I've decided to return this item. My Razer Basilisk never had any issues, and the corresponding app was so easy my aged grandmother could figure it out."
Firefly,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Mouse is a piece of Junk. Like many others, mine started acting up after 2 days. DPI control buttons wouldn't toggle. Mouse would randomly change DPI. When I started my PC in the morning, mouse would lag, and I had to reboot to get it to stop. GHUB software is the absolute worst piece of crap software ever, especially if you plan to use a Powerplay mat. I originally had a G903 Lightspeed but wanted to switch to this for the design profile.

Especially with the Powerplay mat, if you already have a mouse paired with it, it is impossible to remove an old mouse and pair with a new mouse using GHUB. You literally have to uninstall GHUB, and install the older LGS software (better download it now before it becomes unavailable). Then use the LGS software to put the Powerplay mat back into pairing mode. You then pair the new mouse with the Powerplay mat. Once done though, your mouse will work, but you cannot customize anything on the mouse with the LGS software. You then have to uninstall it, and reinstall GHUB. It only took me 2 weeks to find this solution on the internet and it most definitely was not on the Logitech support site.

I had to go through this twice. First to install the G502, and again to reinstall my G903 which is working perfectly."
brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","To begin, I feel compelled to automatically take 2 possible stars away from this product due to the ludicrous price tag that is attached. There is no reason this mouse should cost $149, it is comparable to tons of wireless mice in lower price ranges. This bugs me to start, especially considering the wired version is $49 - pretty sure it shouldn't cost $100 to remove a cable.

That said, the wired version of this mouse is arguably my favorite productivity/gaming mouse in recent memory. The downside was that the cable was terrible (frays, fabric gets caught on everything, etc.). I decided after much time to just pull the trigger on the wireless version, hoping this would fulfill my needs for quite some time.

Safe to say it... did not.

Laughably, the mouse did not work correctly out of the box. Apparently they did not put that extra $100 toward making a quality mouse either. The DPI Shift button, with and without the new logitech software, constantly becomes 'stuck' inputting anywhere from 2 - 50 inputs each time it is clicked. I typically remap this button to something other than DPI shift and have not had this problem with either of the two wired-versions of this mouse I have had, but this problem was persistent to the point where the button was unusable.

TLDR; Absolutely do not spend $150 on this mouse. The wired version is ~$49, and there are many reasonably priced wireless mice otherwise. Most of those probably even work out of the box! (hopefully)"
Alice M. Videlock,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","Initially I thought it was due to a driver issue, I'd click and sometimes it would click twice.
So I tried uninstalling the HID mouse driver, reinstalling, restarting. Same issue.
Then I thought maybe it was the brand new computer I built, so I tried my work computer. Same issue. Tried my old computer. Same issue. Tried my parents computer. Same. Issue.
This is coming from a mouse that had a similar problem - the g703. That mouse started with issues, but somehow fixed itself. I'd still once in a while have a double click here or there, but it was so infrequent that I paid it no mind. Eventually, after 6 years of use it just hit a point where I couldn't click and drag, it'd just continuously click forever.
I deemed it dead, and decided I liked the features of the mouse too much to give up on logitech, surely I wouldn't get similar issues with a new model?

I was wrong.

Three days in the issue happened instantly. On mouse down, click. Part of the way up (before you here the click) the mouse would just start detecting clicks multiple times a second.

I know there are ways to fix it and clean it, but that's not what I'm paying for. I don't want to open the mouse to have to fix something that should just work.

I'm sorry logitech, this is just shameful, and with these issues being so longstanding I just can't go with your products ever again."

thunder2132,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2019","If this mouse works, it's pretty fantastic. I like the layout, it's quick as heck, fairly lightweight for a wireless mouse, and the software, though not what I prefer, works fine for me.

What killed the mouse for me was the dreaded Logitech double-click issue. Less than two days after the item arrived every click was detected as a double-click. It'd click once on the downstroke, and click again on the release. It wasn't dropped, and is in a clean environment. I thought it might be software related, so I removed all Logitech software, uninstalled/cleaned the drivers, and even tried in Linux and in Safe Mode, the problem was still there.

So, it's getting returned, and for $150 I'm not going to gamble on another one.

Update

Ok, so I didn't take my own advice, and I gambled on a second one. I loved this mouse while it was working, it did everything I wanted extremely well, and I figured maybe I just got a lemon. The second one arrived last week, and stopped working last night. Same issues with the left click always detecting as a double-click. You can fix it with new switches, but that involves soldering, and ordering more parts for a $150 mouse. Strongly recommend just staying away entirely, don't gamble like I did."

Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Bought this during a sale for $99. Received the mouse and checked the box for SN and model number, everything looked good. Box appeared to have the original clear plastic wrap, so it wasn't a return or anything. Opened it up, started to charge it and add the custom weights and noticed the SN and the model number were different than what was on the box. The model number that was on the mouse was 810-006427 and on the box was 910-005565. I did some research and the mouse with the 810 model number does NOT have the 25k sensor. So I reached out to Logitech directly and they told me that they couldn't find the serial number in there system and it's likely that this is not a legitimate G502. So processes a return to get it replaced. For the second mouse I had the same problem, box looked new and unopened, but the SN and model on the box was completely different that what the actual mouse had on it. I returned this one as well and ordered directly from the Logitech website. I would not suggest buying this from here (even though it's through the Logitech storefront)"
vibe,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","First of all, the mouse feels small (I wear size L gloves FWIW) compared to the Logitech MX Master 3 and the tiny buttons are placed very close to each other in places where it's very easy to accidentally press. Speaking of buttons, the two buttons directly adjacent to the left of the Left mouse button was one of my biggest frustrations with this device. You cannot remap or disable this button. The default is the DPI increase or decrease setting. When you are gaming or just casually browsing and you accidentally press this button, suddenly the mouse sensitivity is drastically changed. Even when you try to disable these buttons for 'Desktop' and for specific games, it will still adjust the DPI settings.

I really tried to like this mouse despite the bad ergonomics but those two buttons mapped to DPI settings is what made this unusable for me."

Why is it either rock hard and hurts your finger or so loose you will be scrolling all over the place accidentally? Rough on the finger to the point that it hurts. If you bind the middle click to anything it will not be a good time for your finger.

Also why does this mouse not have a physical LED on and off switch? When your computer is on you can disable the annoying lights, then when your PC is off it resets back to its LGB RAINBOW VERY BRIGHT MODE. I wonder why the batteries drain so fast?....

Also no notification if you have the software and drivers that the batteries are low, it just dies. Bad mouse

The large dpi adjustment buttons next to your index finger are also pointless and get in the way. Why would i need to adjust dpi on the fly. Makes no sense. The scroll wheel feels kinda chunky. Hardly ever set it to use the ball bearing. This mouse tries really hard to do cool new innovative stuff, by cramming a bunch of extra funtions in, but it just falls flat and doesn't do anything right."
D. Lackey,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","This mouse looks wonderful, feels wonderful, and the battery life is incredible. Even with heavy use, I might have to charge it once every two weeks. I'm hit or miss regarding the software it comes with but for the most part it's a great mouse with a terrible, terrible (quite literally) game breaking flaw.

The problem is that the switches in this mouse are trash and they will die on you, probably sooner rather than later. My first one lasted maybe a month or two tops before the right click and middle click ceased functioning properly. To Logitech's credit, customer service did promptly issue a replacement, no questions asked, no additional charges applied. The second mouse lasted a little longer but again those exact same issues propped up.

I play a very Final Fantastical MMO and rely on middle mouse for Discord and right click for camera and movement, so when BOTH of these go haywire it's not only frustrating but potentially detrimental to the group I play with.

For casual use I could see this being an incredible mouse, but for gaming it falls short and falls short quickly. We recently picked the Razer Basilisk Ultimate (Wireless) instead and that's been a solid replacement. The G502 has been a disappointment and I'll probably be wary of Logitech mice from here on out."

MTB Quick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2021","The mouse is good. Buttons with good confirmation and ergonomics. It's nicely designed hardware.

BUT... and a BIG but. The software is terrible. Not intuitive and awful UI. Seriously, you'd think a gaming company could put some lipstick on a single window and build back some intuitive function. Nope. I bought this specifically for the on board memory for situations where I can't install or am not allowed admin access. It's a nightmare. I'm a savvy guy but this is really a marvel of convoluted UI. To make matters worse, the documentation is almost non-existent.

Mac users: I'll add that I tried to install G-hub on a Mac and it failed. Flat out failed. I tried to uninstall and reinstall... Fail. I even manually deleted the libraries. Never got it to work.

My primary use is PC and app specific on machines that I cannot modify for various reasons. I need 3 profiles to rapidly switch. The software failed my use case."

For my gaming ASUS ROG STRIX laptop I use the Razer Basilisk Ultimate mouse. Comparing the two would be like comparing a 2023 Mustang GT to 1972 Ford Pinto!

In the end, none of the many troubleshooting steps worked. Bottom line - it's not my job to fix another developer's defective software. I wish Logitech's CEO and corporate staff all the best in recognizing and remedying LGHUB. As for me, I'm sorry I don't have hours and days to keep trying to make it work.

Dan N,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023","This review is based solely on the fact that Logitech is falsely advertising that this mouse will charge with the POWERPLAY mat. It does not. You have to recharge this mouse with the included cord and that is the ONLY way to charge it, despite what Logitech support says --> their own documentation on the Powerplay mat even shows that only the G903 and G703 will charge when connected to the Powerplay system.

If you are purchasing this mouse to use with Powerplay, do not do it until Logitech admits their mistake and offers fixes for those of us stupid enough to believe them.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOUSE!!!"
Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022","Beware, there is a known right click issue with this model. Mine presented itself 2 months outside of the warranty. I emailed Logitech and they told me I was out of luck and suggested 3!! different times that I should buy their latest model.

Its a $2 switch, and about 15 minute repair time.

The problem with the switch is that it builds up static electricity. Literally blowing under the right click fin/face, allowing some humidity in, will discharge the static build up for the time being.

But, you'll be happy to know Logitech was very pleased to hear I was able to repair it myself. This was their top of the line model when I purchased it, and they were unable to stand behind their bad hardware/design decisions. Buy something else."

I touched the box and now my hands have whatever this is on them after washing them multiple times. I used a paper towel to open the box and on the inside of the box, more oil. The mouse itself seemed to be clear of fingerprints or mystery oil, but one of the plastic peels was slightly off (probably from all the fumes of this minty hell) The mouse itself reeks of this now and I'm likely going to just send this one back and go with one where I don't have to wonder how this even happens.

B. Shin,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","It worked well until 5 days past the return period. Now it started developing Logitech mouse's usual left click problem. I've been using the Logitech mouse for the past 20+ years and they ALWAYS had this problem. Even with this $120 mouse. But until now, all the previous Logitech mice showed this problem after about a year or two. Instead of fixing the problem, it now shows up in 2 months. Before, Logitech had a good warranty service, replacing the in-warranty mouse quickly. Now, their website logs you out as soon as you trying to submit a warranty claim. Genius! I have 2 years warranty, but they wouldn't let me file the claim for the barely 1-month-old $120 mouse. Their CEO must have been getting a good stock award for all the unclaimed warranties with this website updates.

Ryan H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","This is perhaps one of the worst mouse I have ever purchased in 30 years of pc gaming. I originally bought the 502 in August 2020 to replace a beloved 602 that was out of stock/discontinued? The issue with the 602 was the switch mechanism on the left mouse button failed after about 2 years. The 502 seems to suffer from the same quality issues as the rest of Logitech's current generation of gaming mice. I got 6 months out of this mouse and I'm already looking for a replacement. So what else is wrong with this mouse? Don't believe this review? Just google Logitech switch and double clicking.

The battery life is abysmal. Be prepared to plug it in every 2 weeks. Compared to the 602 with a pair of AA rechargeable that last 2-3 months.

The body is too small. Compared to the 602 this thing is narrow and light. If you have larger hands you'll likely experience pinky drag.

Except, the first one I bought had a double click issue with the right mouse button. About 1 in 20 times when you click the right mouse button, it would double click instead of single click. So, a lemon, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon.

The second one had a little bit of double click on the left mouse button. About 1 in 500 times, it was pretty rare, so while I was upset that a $120-$150 mouse had an issue like that at all, I could live with it. About two months in, the left click issue got much worse. Now it's about 1 in 8 clicks the left mouse button double clicks, and when I hold left click to drag something around, the mouse frequently ""releases"" the click on its own.

It will occasionally doubly click or not register clicks. This is very frustrating when you are trying to spam through smokes in a game like valorant or buy a frenzy first round. You hold down M1 to spray and it shoots one bullet then stops, then you let off and press again and nothing. It’s very frustrating and expected more out of a 150 dollar mouse.

This is the end of life you can expect for this mouse that only varies with how often you are clicking. The short of it is that Logitech made a money saving decision to switch to a different, cheaper switch manufacturer years back and the last couple of generations of their mouse last only as long as the the left click switch lasts. They have had plenty of time to evaluate and fix the issue and they have decided it makes more business sense to save money on the switches. To be clear, this is no longer a quality brand and should be avoided. Customer service is a nightmare asking you to go through two dozen troubleshooting steps to fix the issue, then they are unresponsive when you have completed those steps and are ready to ship it back to them."

Also the battery lasts forever in this thing (I keep all the LEDs off fyi). I'm tempted to believe this thing runs on nuclear power because I've definitely used it every day for a week or slightly longer without charging it with no issues.

UPDATE: The switches are faulty. Had the middle mouse button fail so I got a replacement, the middle mouse button failed again. Along with the right mouse button.

Add to this, the new maintenance software, G Hub, has one of the worst UI's I have ever seen. It is so complicated, convoluted, non-intuitive, and features like auto-switching profiles based on what application has active focus, are not what I want and they are not easily turned off. When you have to search for 'how do I do X' for your peripheral configuration app, there's a problem. Old software was simple, easy to use, never had to think about it. G Hub is the opposite of that.

I've had a Logitech Performance MX mouse for a decade and it's easy to program a button using the older Logitech software. Let's say you want to have a button automatically close a window on the Mac. Any reasonable software would let you assign the command+w keystroks combo to a button and you are done. The brilliant G Hub software only lets you assign a single key, in this case either command or w but not the combo. So you cannot program a button for this simple action. That's just doesn't serve customers very well. And third party Mac software doesn't work with this mouse. Spare yourself headaches."

It feels like it's made for younger users who don't know that there's a better version out there, and it's more expensive to boot.

I'll keep it for an emergency backup mouse, but I'm going to buy another MX Master to replace my old one."
Kevin Dou,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Upgrading from the wired g502. The mouse itself is great but lgs no longer supports the lightspeed. Instead you are forced to use the buggy ghub software. The current software has connection problems that can be fixed occasionally by restarting the software or the computer, but will also frequently default the programmable buttons to their default function. I’ve programmed several buttons which I use for mmo and dps gaming, and when the software allows the mouse to function properly, it works great, just like my old wired g502. When it doesn’t, the two index buttons on the left of left click will default to dpi up and down, randomly changing my sensitivity.

This mouse is useless with the current ghub limitations. A definite do not buy until lgs supports this or until ghub is fixed."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","I saw a few others mention this but disregarded it; sadly this was a bad call. Bought the mouse to play Escape from Tarkov and it is unplayable. When tapping the right mouse button (to aim) it double-clicks about 50% of the time, causing you to aim down sights then immediately stop. This means if you suddenly need to aim because you encounter another player, it'll cause you to stutter when aiming and will delay things by a few seconds, which is ample enough time for the other player to kill you. After several frustrating deaths I had to go back to my wired G502 which works perfectly with the same game. (for those who know the game, I DID try to set ""aim"" to ""continuous"" and I still had the same problem."

RAHAlpha,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","I read reviews and watched them on YouTube and I thought this was going to be a great mouse. Don't believe everything your read or watch. The whole thing feels like cheap plastic; like a low end one might. The scroll wheel, when on the click setting, feels heavy and stiff and like it will break any minute. The left/right buttons don't inspire confidence either.
The worst thing though is that, when I tried to program it in G Hub, it would lock up and I'd have to force-close G Hub to get back out. I've used G Hub for a long time with a keyboard and had no problems so the problem must be with the mouse.

I feel like I was scammed out of my money using this product... and am just paying Logitech's marketing team. If you want a mouse good for gaming, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE.

Cullen,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020","After a very short period time of using this mouse, it had already developed a major issue when it comes to gaming. The right-click button on the mouse will not hold even when you are physically holding the button down, instead, the holding of the button causing an awkward pulsing of the signal like the button/sensor has gone bad already (this happened within 3-4 months of ownership).

I love the mouse and the ergonomics, but with such a horrible hardware issue there is no way I can suggest this mouse to others."

XYSD,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020","I wish I have read the 1-star review before buying the mouse. The mouse is pretty awesome but I got the double click issue in less than 2 months.

I have uploaded a video, and you need to turn on the volume to hear the sound of clicking and releasing the button. The issue happens at click 5-6, 13-14, 26-27, 42-43, 50-52 (triple click), 71-72, 74-75, 77-78, 92-93.

Scott W,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","Another update 1.5 years in
Along with the double click issue, I now also have the holding click not working issue, so the clicker on this sucker is apparently nearing its end. Sometimes can't drag a window or content as it stops the click press. You can know you have this issue because the mouse has a click sound both when pressed and depressed, so if it stops dragging and then you release the click, you hear the sound. What a waste. Good while it worked. No more expensive Logitech stuff for me.

Updated: Less than a year in
I finally started experiencing the dreaded double click when single clicking. It happens just enough to cause me grief at times. Definitely my last Logitech mouse as they seem very prone to this. After spending $$ on the mouse and wireless pad, this mouse ended up costing a good chunk to not even last a year. I do like the comfort with the wireless. Buyer beware.

Updated: 5 months later
While this mouse is about the same as all Logitech mice I've ever owned (more than I can recall), it ends up about the same as every one of them. It is extremely prone to gathering crude on the bottom side of the mouse. More so than any others I've owned (Razer, Steel, several other brands). It is as if they think the underside of the mouse should be pretty, with different designs and indents. My cat likes to use my mouse pad as her resting spot and dogs are flying around with plenty of hair in the breeze. I think about all of it collects under this mouse better than my air purifier. I'm constantly having to clean it since it grabs everything due to poor underside smoothness. Maybe if I used it in a sterile environment?

Otherwise, the charging, along with Logitech's charge pad, has been working great. It stays charged between 85 and 95%. I worked around the changing DPI when the mouse sleeps by setting up an offline profile on the mouse that matched my normal DPI usage. Then turned off the offline mode. It appears that when the mouse sleeps, it defaults to the offline DPI, so you get that pause of difference each time you start using the mouse.

Probably my last attempt with Logitech. I'll probably try replacing the feet and maybe just smearing some silicon across the bottom parts to see if I can reduce it's pickup of hair and stuff.

Original:
I've owned too many Logitech mice to count over the years - other G502 models, G500 and on. For many years, the G500 was my go to. I think they stopped making it because, well, you apparently just have to keep changing things so you can market something different. At any rate, my last G502 Proteus suffered the same fate of many mice today where the clicker stopped functioning correctly, which of course kind of defeats the purpose of the mouse. This G502 Lightspeed is basically the same mouse as far as I can tell. Maybe a little better tracking, although I never had issues with mice that did half what the advertised tracking is today on these.

I had switched over and tried Razor, Steel and a few other with little to no success. They were either made of cheap parts (plastic/glue that eventually smudged all over) or had similar click issue. Since no company seems capable of producing quality products in 2021, I went back to Logitech.

If you like a bigger size mouse that has weight to it, this is your mouse. After trying other mice that were smaller and 2/3 of less the weight of this mouse, I realized that long term use of a small, light mouse isn't for me. My hand would cramp and my forearm would ache. I also missed the thumb holder of all things.

There are still some flaws in the design of this mouse. I don't know what kind of thumb you should be born with to use all the buttons correctly. If you palm the mouse, you need a thumb long as a finger to easily reach the front thumb buttons. If you claw grip, you need to bend your thumb backwards since you're over shooting the back buttons. You get used to shifting your hand around on it, although it makes for awkward motion and unsteady handling of the mouse when you're trying to be precise. The other buttons are about what you'd expect - feel the same as any other Logitech mouse I've owned.

The mouse wheel is a mixed bag. I like the grip they used on it as other mice often have some texture that doesn't feel that good for the finger. You can switch from free spin to the notched spin where you get tactical feel as you scroll. The free spin is nice, although it's a little too free. I thought I remembered prior versions not being as loose. In any software where you could go scroll happy, the free spin may spin when you don't expect it to or you can accidentally spin a bit as you reposition your fingers for that dang thumb button. I've ended up keep the tactical feel spin set, which is ok.

Given it's a wireless mouse, I opted for the PowerPlay wireless pad to go with it. The downside, if you like a really heavy mouse, is that in order to work with PowerPlay, you have to take the weights out for the charging battery. That seems like yet another big oversight. I personally don't need the weights in it, so it didn't bother me one way or the other.

Without PowerPlay and the lights turned off, I was getting around 60 to 80 hours of charge. Kind of an odd range, although I'm guessing it just depended on how long it sat there in sleep mode when I wasn't using it. With the LEDs turned on, that dropped down closer to 30 to 40 hours. That's still pretty good. I'm not sure why you have lights on a mouse to begin with because, well, your hand is generally on it and you can't see those lights. I guess if you want fancy lights when you're not at your desk, it works ok.

With PowerPlay, the mouse stays charged and I seem to stay somewhere between 80 and 90% charge almost always. It appears to drain down and then charge up a bit to not wear out the battery. The two devices together are exactly what I was hoping for - a wireless mouse that didn't have a cord dragging around and a charger that didn't require me to remember to charge up every time I turned around. I'd highly recommend the pad to go with this.

One fault I've had with most Logitech and other brands is the textured grips and especially the multiple designs on the bottom of the mice. All those indentations are dirt magnets. Sure, they look nice. Maybe they add to the handling of the mouse in some small degree. Maybe it looks nicer than a smooth, plain surface. I'd gladly trade whatever advantages for a completely smooth, easy to clean mouse though. My cat thinks my mouse pad is a bed and the mouse itself a pillow, so I constantly have hair and just whatever body oils come off my hands onto the mouse over time. Cleaning is such a pain and when any hair or residue gets on the under side of the mouse, you'll notice it tracking oddly. I'm not a slob by any means - I'd have issues here regardless of wild vermin roaming the house.

Lastly is the software. Everything you have anymore wants to install some crap in your system tray. And from what I can tell, that software is what reminds your mouse what DPI you have it set to. So while the software works ok and I've not crashed or seen any issues out of it, the one thing that I have noticed is that the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes and soon as you start moving it instantly wakes up. There is a bit of lag between when the mouse wakes and the software sees it back alive. So the mouse is working instantly, although the DPI of the mouse is the factory default and not the custom setting. So there's this short bit of time where your DPI isn't what you think it is. Once the software realizes the mouse is awake, it tells it to change and things are good once again. Just annoying that they don't appear to save the settings on the mouse itself. Setup is a bit confusing at times with all the options, so I could have missed it.

Overall, the mouse works just like I expected. I was a little disappointed that this was almost a clone to the mouse I owned 5 or 6 years, although I like that mouse a lot, so that's ok. I'm pretty sure the wheel may be a little bit of downgrade and the sound of the clicks is a bit loud compared to some. It is very comfortable though and it felt like coming home after a couple days use. Being wireless, I'm about as happy as I could probably be, so I'd recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a wireless, heavier side, large mouse."
Mike,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","I'm trying really hard to like this mouse, I really am. I like its ergonomics, its features, and even the programmable macro buttons.

This is now the second time I've re-written this review because I was trying to be fair, but the connectivity for the mouse is just so bad, that I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone. Intermittently, the mouse will lose connection and try to 'interpolate' where the cursor should be based on the last direction it was moving. This results in very choppy movement even on low report rate. This has been happening on multiple computers with different Operating Systems (Windows 10, 11, Linux.) I tried numerous solutions around the internet, Such as:

*Cleaning the sensor
*Trying different mouse pads and surfaces
*Reinstalling Logitech's driver software
*Uninstalling the Logitech Drivers and using the onboard memory manager program instead
*Lowering the report rate down to 125Hz
*Used an extension cable to bring the receiver closer to the mouse, to a point it doesn't make sense to be wireless anymore.

I've even forgone the wireless aspect and connected it physically via USB Micro (Yes, this mouse which costs a hundred dollars in 2024, still uses USB Micro instead of C.) And the way Logitech engineers made this mouse, its annoying to try and connect physically. Sure, you may have a couple USB Micro cables still laying around, but do you have one that's thin enough? Because the female connection for USB Micro is so recessed into a narrow inset, most cables you have are probably too wide to fit in the inset. Sure, you can use the included cable but in my case it stopped working after 2 months of use. No clue why it had to be engineered this way, because I've used both an MX Master 2, and 3 and never had this design flaw.

None of these attempted solutions alleviated the fact my mouse has intermittent connection issues. I had a Logitech G604 wireless mouse and that too had the same problem: Intermittent choppy movement. I'm not sure whats going on at Logitech, but reading around online on forums, I'm not the only person having such an issue. It feels like the quality is going down, since this is the second mouse I've bought from Logi that costs over a hundred dollars, that ended up being unusable. And at this stage, its looking like I'm not going to be a returning customer.

Stay away like its the plague."
BC,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","TLDR: This is a great mouse that is ruined by bad switches

I have been waiting for the wireless version of this mouse for years, since the original came out. I was a bit put off by the price but when my MX Revolution finally broke beyond my ability to repair it, I decided to buy this.

At first I was a bit let down, I wasn't really used to a light mouse and I mistook that as a sign of poor quality. It took a couple days for me to really start to enjoy using it and after that I was hooked. It has the perfect shape for my hand, the button arrangement is easy for me to use and the lack of weight makes it very easy to move quickly or lift up to reposition without straining to keep a grip on it. The only thing I changed early on was to use some grip tape on the main buttons so I had more control. The battery life is good, it lasts longer than my MX battery did so I have no complaints about that. G-Hub is required to use it but once you have everything set up the way you want, you can store the settings to the mouse and uninstall it if it bothers you that much, I came from Setpoint so G-Hub doesn't seem that bad.

So why the 1 star review after all this good ? The switches, within 2 weeks of owning this mouse I was getting double clicks on the left mouse button, it started with just one every once and awhile but then it started to happen more and more often, at first I thought (hoped) it was the grip tape I added, so I removed it, no change. I did find that I could get it to work normally if I pressed down hard and held the mouse button for a bit longer than I normally would but that just isn't something I was willing to do every time. So I came here thinking I would exchange it for a new one but they are out of stock. Between that and the fact that I really like so much about this mouse I decided to fix it myself and keep it. I bought some Kaith red micro switches and replaced the two main mouse switches with them. This worked great and I now have a perfect mouse, but I shouldn't need to fix a new product. If I was the only person who had this experience I would chalk it up to one bad product out of millions and still give it a good review but so many others have the same double click issues that this is obviously a QC issue that needs to be resolved. Logitech, if you read this, please, please fix this issue. You have an amazing product that is being ruined by a couple of $.50 switches.

To anyone else having this issue, if you want to go the same route I went just search ""G502 Lightspeed Full Teardown / Switch Replacement"" and there is a Reddit post that walks you through what to do with pics, it's really very easy if you know how to solder. If anyone has any questions just ask here and I will be happy to add any info that is needed."
Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I've been a loyal Logitech buyer since mx518, but I can't anymore. This is now the 4th Logi mouse I've had with bad switches within 2 years, and now the sensor is going bad. It has been about 1 year of use on this one. I'm not RMA'ing these anymore, I'd just rather purchase something that is reliable.

There are some baffling quality choices they've made on these. Not only in the switches that seem to have an abhorrent fail rate, but in just the quality. I realize now that I've gotten an equivalent replacement from another brand how much actual garbage is here. The feet are baffling. they are the thickness and flexibility of electric tape. I use a hard mat and they started folding over within months. The one around the sensor has a gap. since this is also recessed a bit (not the case on the new different-brand mouse) it's like it's begging to collect the most garbage possible. Which made the initial sensor issues so frustrating to figure out until it got overt. I couldn't tell if a random hair or something just got in there. It also makes an audible loose shake when you move it quickly right out of the box. That just feels and sounds bad. The switches all have a squishy actuation to them that feel imprecise.

I have large hands, so even though the size feels ok, the placement of the dpi switches are impossible to not smash mid-match at key times. mileage may vary there.

I had a lot of people recommend the 502 after the other high-end logi models I had already replaced. So the seem popular. But this was my last try with Logitech. I don't know how you charge this much for hardware like this.

Also of mention: the software, G-hub, though it looked fine, was functionally kind of a nightmare. and especially with other Logi peripherals. before replacing this, support had put forth that maybe closing the mouse's own software while running games would stop the sensor issue. that was actually the exact point where I just laughed, pulled up an amazon tab and bought a different brand. and so far, that was a fantastic decision."
Thomas Cederlof,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I'm so sick of people praising Logitech support. They are so SO bad at their customer support. Which is a shame, because usually their physical product is good but half the time there's is some small flaw that causes their products (whether it's mouse, keyboard or headset). Wouldn't be as much of a problem if it happens within the first 30 days through Amazon to get a replacement. But the minute you have to go through the Logitech Customer Support just consider yourself screwed (you ain't getting a replacement back). Their website and customer support is so backwards and convoluted it's almost like it's on purpose. It worked okay when I first bought, then as soon as I can't do an Amazon return, *POOF* it just fails to connect or turn on. Then you refer to their official FAQ, Reddit and random Google searches to troubleshoot. Nothing works. So you try to create a ticket, you tell them that you tried everything multiple times with nothing fixing it, yet Logitech Customer Support websites keep requiring you to login, then they refer you to the FAQ like 100 times, then to a AI chatbot where you have to say ""NOT HELPFUL"" to every same ""solution"" you've already read and tried 100 times. Then when you get a ""live chat agent"", they ask the SAME QUESTIONS, AGAIN, but spanned out over a 45 minute time waste. Then they say ""Give us your Name and Address, we will create a ticket number and email you. Then you get the email, with no information other then a ticket number they tell you refer but it literally doesn't exist on your account options or anything on their website. So you reply to the email and say just link me to the ticket, and their response is the LITERAL exact email that your responding too, but piled on that is them asking to refer to the FAQ and asking for your Name and address yet again as if they just didn't save that information. Do this over a few months and its like great, I've already done this 5-10 in this weird feed back loop when getting assistance can be easily done one time. Logitech SUCKS. Out of $115. These people suck so bad at customer support, so yeah if someone tells you that Logitech Support is good, they are dumb or lying. Keep that in mind."
Mike G,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019","As fast or faster than the wired version. I use the Logitech charging mouse pad. The only issue is I have to turn it off and on someones to fix the LEDs from not matching or loading the profile normally fixes it.

When it comes to the Logitech Program... its annoying AF.

Update:
12/5/2019

The double-clicking has gotten really noticeable. Not bad enough it affects me in FPS games cause I am just shootings. I do notice it when using google and I double click things. Happens 1/20 or sometimes more or less. Its sad the mouse is not as good as the wired version. I have 5 of the wired versions for my desktop, laptop, traveling, work, and at my other home. The mouse otherwise is great other than sometimes it losing the profile I am on or not being detected in the GHUB which is a GHUB issue and always has been unless you use wired. I take that back cause it has even lost my speakers and my keyboard that is wired. The GHUB program is a terrible man. I wouldn't use it but for the G502 Light Speed you cant use the old software that is simple and has no issues. I have thought about switching back to the old wired G502 and gaming back to the old program, but I will wait until I get the point where I can't stand the double-clicking. Most other games from FPS I normally use a controller for RPG, sports, or racing games. GHUB is terrible. Don't even get me started about that stupid program or just google all the issues people have had with it. I once had to reformat my computer to get it uninstalled so I could reinstall it to get it to update because the update froze as it does for a lot of people and the ways to fix it were not working like normal. I would not use this mouse. The price is high but so are all really nice things and the double-clicking and software which I think is the worse part I would not buy right now."
Tim Bohrer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Mouse jumps around a lot, it is easily the best mouse I have ever had. Yet, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. If you are moving the mouse even if you aren't touching the scroll wheel it will jump around and move on its own. Kinda insane because you can't scroll through webpages, or play games that utilize the mouse wheel. The worst part is that there isn't a fix for it other than ""firmware update"" which I am up to date.

Seems simple enough to program the mouse to ignore oposite rolling unless rolling for more than 2 or 3 clicks or what ever... Seems even easier to give the custom program a sliding scale for sensitivity for the mouse, or any other mouse out there.

I spent a lot extra and have the wireless charging pad and got this mouse to go with it. Ugh, what a pain in the butt."
bahmtoll,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I would've given 0 Star if I could've.

I originally had G502 Hero (Wired) I liked it, so I ordered wireless one G502 Lightspeed with 25K HERO sensor.
When i received, I read the box since there are two different model for G502 Lightspeed.
One is old model with 16K sensor, newer model is with 25K sensor.
But on the box says 16K sensor. So checked the model number and serial number under the bottom cover of the mouse. It was shocking.

1) First, the number on the box were stickers covered original one. (I am not sure if the original one comes like that since i did not take it off. I needed to return.

2) The model number on the mouse was 810-006427 which was old model.
(Newer model number should be 910-005565)
The model number on the box has the newer model number.

3) I also checked serial number, the number on the box and the number on the bottom of the mouse did not match either.

I contacted AMAZON, and they said they were sorry and made the replacement taking 2 more days, guess what ?
The same thing happened.

And additionally, the replacement looks like it was used - checked the skid pad under the mouse.
The plastic cover was not in the correct way and skid pad was not fresh.
How can this happen with plastic sealed product ?

The Product Number and the serial number on the box were stickers. I don't know actual product was made like that. But what I know is they came with plastic covers which were sealed.

At this point, I don't know what to do. returning and getting a replacement will make the same thing happen again for sure because AMAZON will not be able to open the box before shipping to check.
even if they do, that means I am going to receive opened box.

The worst experience ever."
Vladislav,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I bought two of these for $163 each, and I just had to throw away mine. Yes, it lasted for about 4-5 years or so, but it's not enough when a mouse costs like three very good mice. I had to replace my older top-end Logitech mouse for the exact same reason. They've known about the issue, but they wouldn't start using different switches. It makes them money at the end of the day. Reviewers never mention this in video reviews either because they get paid, so you'll find out about it later. I'd recommend going for the cheaper version for $40. It's the ""G502 HERO"" wired version. It's WAY worth $40. The mouse is amazing.

I have to say this Hero sensor is the best sensor I've ever seen in a mouse. The mouse is amazing in all other aspects. The movement is precise, and I definitely started enjoying FPS games way more. You always feel in control, and aiming is just so much fun."

M. Chase Masters,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","Logitech's higher end mice: G903 Lightspeed and the G502 Lightspeed have a common problem: double-clicking. Over a short period of time, it can get very aggravating.

I bought both models, one for me and one for my girlfriend. In several months both acquired the double click problem from their ""Omron"" switches Logitech uses. So my mice are under warranty, right? So I put in a ticket on Logitech's site (which that alone is confusing) and days later I receive canned emails asking me to go through endless troubleshooting steps, which I did. Days later I received an email asking me to record videos with my smartphone camera of the mouse, it's serial number, and a handwritten note with the case number, provide a copy of my receipt, record another video of their ""double click"" test and upload all of this to a Google Drive folder and provide them the link to it.

I do all this. I then receive an email from their technical support telling me they need to inspect my mouse. So after all that, they want me to stick the mouse in a box and ship it to them. Of course, this is simply to try and wear you out, so you give up.

Take my word for it, if you are a gamer do not buy these mice. I'd suggest the Razer mice that come with their optical switches. They last longer than Logitech's mechanical, and they are also less prone to Logitech's double-clicking nightmares."
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","I bought this to replace my previous wired g502 mouse. The new Logitech software for managing the mouse is absolutely garbage. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen constantly, where I have to go into task manager and quit every related process, then restart the software. This happens whenever my computer disconnects from a network connection as well. Anytime I lose network connection, the Ghub software goes back to the infinite loading screen glitch. I game on my laptop a lot and I will connect to a hotspot occasionally, then disconnect when I'm done. Every time network changes happen it bricks there GHub app, forcing me to quit all processes, etc. It makes it so anytime I change network settings I have to go through a 5 minute process to get my mouse working again. And this seems to be a known issue, with several forums throughout reddit, Logitech website, etc, yet the do nothing to resolve it. I can't recommend this mouse to anyone with this problems."
Matthew Fintonis,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I've been using Logitech mice for a long time, and I've loved every single one including the G502. It's amazing to use with the powerplay mouse pad and have a wireless mouse that never has to be recharged. However, there has been a recurring theme with these mice and that is the infamous double click issue. Before my G502, I had a G900 that I had for a couple years that never experienced this issue. I eventually had to replace that one though because the battery stopped holding a charge. I then got the G903, theoretically the same identical mouse but also supported the then new powerplay mousepad. Well, I went through THREE of them and they all started producing a double click issue after only a couple months after purchase. I thought maybe there was something wrong with that model so I ended up purchasing the G502. Well, I bought it back in March and it's only July and guess what? Double-clicking issue is showing up already. Logitech, you make great products, but this double click issue is now in so many of your mice that I can no longer recommend your brand to my friends and I can no longer trust Logitech peripherals. Even if it wasn't for the switch issue, the software you created, Logitech G Hub, is the most atrocious piece of software I have ever used. It seemingly only wants to work half the time with most of the time it just failing to launch without a complete uninstall and reinstall. Logitech, you need to step up your game with your quality assurance and your software development if you want to compete in this crowded market."

It’s annoying that the software has to load before the mouse actually works as intended, but even then the settings won’t save. I’ve done the research to try and fix it.

Maybe there is something that I am missing, but the G-Hub has no tutorial, and after hours of trying to figure it out and searching the web for help, I've decided to return this item. My Razer Basilisk never had any issues, and the corresponding app was so easy my aged grandmother could figure it out."
Firefly,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Mouse is a piece of Junk. Like many others, mine started acting up after 2 days. DPI control buttons wouldn't toggle. Mouse would randomly change DPI. When I started my PC in the morning, mouse would lag, and I had to reboot to get it to stop. GHUB software is the absolute worst piece of crap software ever, especially if you plan to use a Powerplay mat. I originally had a G903 Lightspeed but wanted to switch to this for the design profile.

Especially with the Powerplay mat, if you already have a mouse paired with it, it is impossible to remove an old mouse and pair with a new mouse using GHUB. You literally have to uninstall GHUB, and install the older LGS software (better download it now before it becomes unavailable). Then use the LGS software to put the Powerplay mat back into pairing mode. You then pair the new mouse with the Powerplay mat. Once done though, your mouse will work, but you cannot customize anything on the mouse with the LGS software. You then have to uninstall it, and reinstall GHUB. It only took me 2 weeks to find this solution on the internet and it most definitely was not on the Logitech support site.

I had to go through this twice. First to install the G502, and again to reinstall my G903 which is working perfectly."
brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","To begin, I feel compelled to automatically take 2 possible stars away from this product due to the ludicrous price tag that is attached. There is no reason this mouse should cost $149, it is comparable to tons of wireless mice in lower price ranges. This bugs me to start, especially considering the wired version is $49 - pretty sure it shouldn't cost $100 to remove a cable.

That said, the wired version of this mouse is arguably my favorite productivity/gaming mouse in recent memory. The downside was that the cable was terrible (frays, fabric gets caught on everything, etc.). I decided after much time to just pull the trigger on the wireless version, hoping this would fulfill my needs for quite some time.

Safe to say it... did not.

Laughably, the mouse did not work correctly out of the box. Apparently they did not put that extra $100 toward making a quality mouse either. The DPI Shift button, with and without the new logitech software, constantly becomes 'stuck' inputting anywhere from 2 - 50 inputs each time it is clicked. I typically remap this button to something other than DPI shift and have not had this problem with either of the two wired-versions of this mouse I have had, but this problem was persistent to the point where the button was unusable.

TLDR; Absolutely do not spend $150 on this mouse. The wired version is ~$49, and there are many reasonably priced wireless mice otherwise. Most of those probably even work out of the box! (hopefully)"
Alice M. Videlock,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","Initially I thought it was due to a driver issue, I'd click and sometimes it would click twice.
So I tried uninstalling the HID mouse driver, reinstalling, restarting. Same issue.
Then I thought maybe it was the brand new computer I built, so I tried my work computer. Same issue. Tried my old computer. Same issue. Tried my parents computer. Same. Issue.
This is coming from a mouse that had a similar problem - the g703. That mouse started with issues, but somehow fixed itself. I'd still once in a while have a double click here or there, but it was so infrequent that I paid it no mind. Eventually, after 6 years of use it just hit a point where I couldn't click and drag, it'd just continuously click forever.
I deemed it dead, and decided I liked the features of the mouse too much to give up on logitech, surely I wouldn't get similar issues with a new model?

I was wrong.

Three days in the issue happened instantly. On mouse down, click. Part of the way up (before you here the click) the mouse would just start detecting clicks multiple times a second.

I know there are ways to fix it and clean it, but that's not what I'm paying for. I don't want to open the mouse to have to fix something that should just work.

I'm sorry logitech, this is just shameful, and with these issues being so longstanding I just can't go with your products ever again."

What killed the mouse for me was the dreaded Logitech double-click issue. Less than two days after the item arrived every click was detected as a double-click. It'd click once on the downstroke, and click again on the release. It wasn't dropped, and is in a clean environment. I thought it might be software related, so I removed all Logitech software, uninstalled/cleaned the drivers, and even tried in Linux and in Safe Mode, the problem was still there.

So, it's getting returned, and for $150 I'm not going to gamble on another one.

Update

Ok, so I didn't take my own advice, and I gambled on a second one. I loved this mouse while it was working, it did everything I wanted extremely well, and I figured maybe I just got a lemon. The second one arrived last week, and stopped working last night. Same issues with the left click always detecting as a double-click. You can fix it with new switches, but that involves soldering, and ordering more parts for a $150 mouse. Strongly recommend just staying away entirely, don't gamble like I did."

Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Bought this during a sale for $99. Received the mouse and checked the box for SN and model number, everything looked good. Box appeared to have the original clear plastic wrap, so it wasn't a return or anything. Opened it up, started to charge it and add the custom weights and noticed the SN and the model number were different than what was on the box. The model number that was on the mouse was 810-006427 and on the box was 910-005565. I did some research and the mouse with the 810 model number does NOT have the 25k sensor. So I reached out to Logitech directly and they told me that they couldn't find the serial number in there system and it's likely that this is not a legitimate G502. So processes a return to get it replaced. For the second mouse I had the same problem, box looked new and unopened, but the SN and model on the box was completely different that what the actual mouse had on it. I returned this one as well and ordered directly from the Logitech website. I would not suggest buying this from here (even though it's through the Logitech storefront)"
vibe,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","First of all, the mouse feels small (I wear size L gloves FWIW) compared to the Logitech MX Master 3 and the tiny buttons are placed very close to each other in places where it's very easy to accidentally press. Speaking of buttons, the two buttons directly adjacent to the left of the Left mouse button was one of my biggest frustrations with this device. You cannot remap or disable this button. The default is the DPI increase or decrease setting. When you are gaming or just casually browsing and you accidentally press this button, suddenly the mouse sensitivity is drastically changed. Even when you try to disable these buttons for 'Desktop' and for specific games, it will still adjust the DPI settings.

I really tried to like this mouse despite the bad ergonomics but those two buttons mapped to DPI settings is what made this unusable for me."

D. Lackey,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","This mouse looks wonderful, feels wonderful, and the battery life is incredible. Even with heavy use, I might have to charge it once every two weeks. I'm hit or miss regarding the software it comes with but for the most part it's a great mouse with a terrible, terrible (quite literally) game breaking flaw.

The problem is that the switches in this mouse are trash and they will die on you, probably sooner rather than later. My first one lasted maybe a month or two tops before the right click and middle click ceased functioning properly. To Logitech's credit, customer service did promptly issue a replacement, no questions asked, no additional charges applied. The second mouse lasted a little longer but again those exact same issues propped up.

I play a very Final Fantastical MMO and rely on middle mouse for Discord and right click for camera and movement, so when BOTH of these go haywire it's not only frustrating but potentially detrimental to the group I play with.

For casual use I could see this being an incredible mouse, but for gaming it falls short and falls short quickly. We recently picked the Razer Basilisk Ultimate (Wireless) instead and that's been a solid replacement. The G502 has been a disappointment and I'll probably be wary of Logitech mice from here on out."
Cole Yarbrough,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","This is a REAL CERTIFIED GAMER ITEM. Despite being listed as new, my mouse has clearly been put through a few rounds of unshowered leage of legends use. With gamer gunk stuck to the groove where my innocent thumb would go, as well as packed into the buttons.

Personally? I have no idea if it even works, as this mouse is a tad too EXTREME for my casual hygenic gaming lifestyle, and will therefore be returned immediately."
MTB Quick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2021","The mouse is good. Buttons with good confirmation and ergonomics. It's nicely designed hardware.

BUT... and a BIG but. The software is terrible. Not intuitive and awful UI. Seriously, you'd think a gaming company could put some lipstick on a single window and build back some intuitive function. Nope. I bought this specifically for the on board memory for situations where I can't install or am not allowed admin access. It's a nightmare. I'm a savvy guy but this is really a marvel of convoluted UI. To make matters worse, the documentation is almost non-existent.

Mac users: I'll add that I tried to install G-hub on a Mac and it failed. Flat out failed. I tried to uninstall and reinstall... Fail. I even manually deleted the libraries. Never got it to work.

My primary use is PC and app specific on machines that I cannot modify for various reasons. I need 3 profiles to rapidly switch. The software failed my use case."
Michael Spengler,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023","I received this mouse today after reading a vast number of 1-star reviews and shrugging them off as “sour grapes” reviews. After receiving the mouse, downloading the GHUB, and using it for about 30 minutes, I put it back in the box, afraid I might break it before I could return it for a refund. For my gaming ASUS ROG STRIX laptop I use the Razer Basilisk Ultimate mouse. Comparing the two would be like comparing a 2023 Mustang GT to 1972 Ford Pinto! I am SO disappointed in the quality of this Logitech mouse. Lightweight, fragile, frail are just a few descriptive words that come to mind. AVOID AT ALL COST!"
Mongoose,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2023","Long time, and loyal Logitech user. I'm very sad to report that I wasted hours, and hours, and hours, of researching the necessary LGHUB software diagnostic steps for the G502. I persued and tried the many published lists of very detailed work-arounds and things to try,. The LGHUB won't load past the animation screen. In the end, none of the many troubleshooting steps worked. Bottom line - it's not my job to fix another developer's defective software. I wish Logitech's CEO and corporate staff all the best in recognizing and remedying LGHUB. As for me, I'm sorry I don't have hours and days to keep trying to make it work. For the millions of G502 users who made it work, you have my admiration."
Dan N,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023","This review is based solely on the fact that Logitech is falsely advertising that this mouse will charge with the POWERPLAY mat. It does not. You have to recharge this mouse with the included cord and that is the ONLY way to charge it, despite what Logitech support says --> their own documentation on the Powerplay mat even shows that only the G903 and G703 will charge when connected to the Powerplay system.

If you are purchasing this mouse to use with Powerplay, do not do it until Logitech admits their mistake and offers fixes for those of us stupid enough to believe them.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOUSE!!!"
Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022","Beware, there is a known right click issue with this model. Mine presented itself 2 months outside of the warranty. I emailed Logitech and they told me I was out of luck and suggested 3!! different times that I should buy their latest model.

Its a $2 switch, and about 15 minute repair time.

The problem with the switch is that it builds up static electricity. Literally blowing under the right click fin/face, allowing some humidity in, will discharge the static build up for the time being.

But, you'll be happy to know Logitech was very pleased to hear I was able to repair it myself. This was their top of the line model when I purchased it, and they were unable to stand behind their bad hardware/design decisions. Buy something else."
Peter Q.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022","Okay so no joke. I received this mouse sealed, but I could see through the plastic that it seemed to be stuck to the box a little bit. I open it up and my GOD. This thing is covered in what smells like Icy Hot? Tiger Balm? Like really minty, but in a medicinal way. I touched the box and now my hands have whatever this is on them after washing them multiple times. I used a paper towel to open the box and on the inside of the box, more oil. The mouse itself seemed to be clear of fingerprints or mystery oil, but one of the plastic peels was slightly off (probably from all the fumes of this minty hell) The mouse itself reeks of this now and I'm likely going to just send this one back and go with one where I don't have to wonder how this even happens.

Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","So a week after the 2 year warranty expired, my right click mouse button clicks multiple times when held down. I looked online and it's a pretty common problem with this mouse. I am not even a hardcore gamer, so I would say this mouse had a pretty comfortable desk life with me. I would expect a mouse that costs over 100 dollars to last at least 3-4 years. It was nice while it lasted, but shelling over 100 dollars for a mouse every 2 years + a week is not happening - I am very disappointment in the quality of logitech products. Will look elsewhere."

B. Shin,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","It worked well until 5 days past the return period. Now it started developing Logitech mouse's usual left click problem. I've been using the Logitech mouse for the past 20+ years and they ALWAYS had this problem. Even with this $120 mouse. But until now, all the previous Logitech mice showed this problem after about a year or two. Instead of fixing the problem, it now shows up in 2 months. Before, Logitech had a good warranty service, replacing the in-warranty mouse quickly. Now, their website logs you out as soon as you trying to submit a warranty claim. Genius! I have 2 years warranty, but they wouldn't let me file the claim for the barely 1-month-old $120 mouse. Their CEO must have been getting a good stock award for all the unclaimed warranties with this website updates. Well, never again going with Logitech for me, typing this on Logitech lightspeed wireless keyboard.
Their product is technologically advanced, but their disgusting CEO probably forced engineers to design it to be failed miserably in a few months."
Ryan H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","This is perhaps one of the worst mouse I have ever purchased in 30 years of pc gaming. I originally bought the 502 in August 2020 to replace a beloved 602 that was out of stock/discontinued? The issue with the 602 was the switch mechanism on the left mouse button failed after about 2 years. The 502 seems to suffer from the same quality issues as the rest of Logitech's current generation of gaming mice. I got 6 months out of this mouse and I'm already looking for a replacement. So what else is wrong with this mouse? Don't believe this review? Just google Logitech switch and double clicking.

The battery life is abysmal. Be prepared to plug it in every 2 weeks. Compared to the 602 with a pair of AA rechargeable that last 2-3 months.

The body is too small. Compared to the 602 this thing is narrow and light. If you have larger hands you'll likely experience pinky drag.

The ratcheting scroll wheel is chunky and cheap feeling.

What's good about it? The optical precision, very smooth cursor and that's about it."
Anthony Todaro,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","Do not buy this mouse. The software makes it unusable.

Do not buy this mouse. Get a different one."
StevenSW57,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022","This is NOT a Wireless mouse. In order for it to be wireless, you have to FREQUENTLY buy a USB connection and Inch long connector (LOGI BOLT USB RECEIVER and LOGI USB-C to A ADAPTOR) for 30.00 for the pair. If you don't have these then you have a Hard wired mice. It's the gift that keeps on costing. They make good mice, I should know I've bought two of them this year. I think I'll just buy a regular wireless mouse that doesn't seek to price gouge you with frivolous purchases. I wanted a wireless mouse. All I got was a wired mouse that you have to keep spending money on. DON""T BUY THIS MOUSE. You'll be sorry you did."
Dave L,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2021","I'm coming from a wired G502, it is as close to a perfect mouse that you can get. So I expected to love this mouse, and I do, very comfortable, lots of buttons, great battery life.

Except, the first one I bought had a double click issue with the right mouse button. About 1 in 20 times when you click the right mouse button, it would double click instead of single click. So, a lemon, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon.

The second one had a little bit of double click on the left mouse button. About 1 in 500 times, it was pretty rare, so while I was upset that a $120-$150 mouse had an issue like that at all, I could live with it. About two months in, the left click issue got much worse. Now it's about 1 in 8 clicks the left mouse button double clicks, and when I hold left click to drag something around, the mouse frequently ""releases"" the click on its own.

It's a fantastic mouse but Logitech has serious quality control issues."
Hunter Day,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2021","I have had this mouse for about a year now. I liked it enough out of the box to not return it. It is a heavy mouse which I don’t prefer but it’s overall a good mouse. After a year of use for casual gaming, I’ve began noticing significant issues with the M1 (left click) switch. It will occasionally doubly click or not register clicks. This is very frustrating when you are trying to spam through smokes in a game like valorant or buy a frenzy first round. You hold down M1 to spray and it shoots one bullet then stops, then you let off and press again and nothing. It’s very frustrating and expected more out of a 150 dollar mouse. I generally have heard good things about Logitech mice and will probably go with a G Pro wireless to give them another chance but the G502 did not stand the test of time. Also the practicality of putting buttons right next to the M1 button doesn’t exist."

I have had to have this specific mouse replaced twice now and the same issue confuses to happen.

After only a few months of moderate gaming, the mouse clicks will start to let go randomly making games that you have to hold down a mouse click near impossible to play.

I know this is a different product but it is from Logitech as well. I have had to have two different model headsets replaced because they eventually will start to randomly disconnect or get start. The most recent one was only replaced a few weeks ago and right off the bat I am getting electrical static as if there is an electrical short in the wiring.

I don’t plan on buy another Logitech device ever again."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","As many others have said, switches lasted about 6 months, then I started getting the double click issue and I was unable to drag items consistently. This is the end of life you can expect for this mouse that only varies with how often you are clicking. The short of it is that Logitech made a money saving decision to switch to a different, cheaper switch manufacturer years back and the last couple of generations of their mouse last only as long as the the left click switch lasts. They have had plenty of time to evaluate and fix the issue and they have decided it makes more business sense to save money on the switches. To be clear, this is no longer a quality brand and should be avoided. Customer service is a nightmare asking you to go through two dozen troubleshooting steps to fix the issue, then they are unresponsive when you have completed those steps and are ready to ship it back to them."
Crusty Chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","Imagine... you're using your G502, but except that annoying slight tug of the wire isn't there anymore. You are free, like a man urinating off the side of the grand canyon. You feel the wind between your legs. Free to aim where ever you'd like :)

Also the battery lasts forever in this thing (I keep all the LEDs off fyi). I'm tempted to believe this thing runs on nuclear power because I've definitely used it every day for a week or slightly longer without charging it with no issues.

UPDATE: The switches are faulty. Had the middle mouse button fail so I got a replacement, the middle mouse button failed again. Along with the right mouse button. Logitech does not honor a full warranty on replacement mice. Only the period of the warranty that applies to the original product. This is a fault product and not worth buying in my experience."
bryan newby,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019","The mouse/software constantly loses the key binds that have been set. They still display in the settings as set, they just don't work. Shutting the software down and restarting it doesn't do anything, rebooting the PC will cause it to work again (which I would think points more to a software than a mechanical issue). Add to this, the new maintenance software, G Hub, has one of the worst UI's I have ever seen. It is so complicated, convoluted, non-intuitive, and features like auto-switching profiles based on what application has active focus, are not what I want and they are not easily turned off. When you have to search for 'how do I do X' for your peripheral configuration app, there's a problem. Old software was simple, easy to use, never had to think about it. G Hub is the opposite of that. You cannot install the old software with this mouse, you're stuck with G Hub."
BradB,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","Battery life is nowhere near “40 hours” as the software states with RGB off.

Speaking of battery. When in wireless mode mouse will not auto off or sleep when pc is in sleep mode or off. So if you forget to turn the mouse off before bed congratulations you just lost all those hours of battery life.

Sometimes it immediately sets itself back to the DPI you want on system reboot. Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes for the software to catch up. Meanwhile you’re stuck at the default 400dpi or whatever it is.

Small for my hands.

It’s a return for me. Hopefully others have better luck."
Delinquent,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","The required G Hub software for configuring the mouse is dysfunctional. It's the worst piece of software I've dealt with in years. One excellent capability of this mouse is having 11 so-called programmable buttons. I've had a Logitech Performance MX mouse for a decade and it's easy to program a button using the older Logitech software. Let's say you want to have a button automatically close a window on the Mac. Any reasonable software would let you assign the command+w keystroks combo to a button and you are done. The brilliant G Hub software only lets you assign a single key, in this case either command or w but not the combo. So you cannot program a button for this simple action. That's just doesn't serve customers very well. And third party Mac software doesn't work with this mouse. Spare yourself headaches."

No clue how it could possibly take this long to provide me a replacement. I've emailed them multiple times, opened an additional ticket, and still have NO MOUSE.

Please, don't make the mistake I did and waste $150 on this worthless mouse. When it works, it's just fine. When it inevitably breaks from basic use, don't count on Logitech standing by their warranty. What a massive waste of money and time.

UPDATE: 1 Star!! For such an expensive mouse, I am surprised that of all issues, this is what I came across. The right-click button is either too sensitive or broken. It clicks too fast (or two times) when gently clicked. That has caused an issue for me during gameplay and photo-editing.

L. Thompson,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","I'd worn out the rubber grips on my MX Master again, so went to replace it and hopefully upgrade, but this mouse, while looking snazzy, is definitely NOT an upgrade - it's fine for normal mousing, but I've got slightly larger hands and this mouse is very light (even with all the weights in), and feels ""flimsy"", plus the scrollwheel doesn't have an easily-pressed freescroll button like the MX Master does. It feels like it's made for younger users who don't know that there's a better version out there, and it's more expensive to boot.

I'll keep it for an emergency backup mouse, but I'm going to buy another MX Master to replace my old one."
Kevin Dou,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Upgrading from the wired g502. The mouse itself is great but lgs no longer supports the lightspeed. Instead you are forced to use the buggy ghub software. The current software has connection problems that can be fixed occasionally by restarting the software or the computer, but will also frequently default the programmable buttons to their default function. I’ve programmed several buttons which I use for mmo and dps gaming, and when the software allows the mouse to function properly, it works great, just like my old wired g502. When it doesn’t, the two index buttons on the left of left click will default to dpi up and down, randomly changing my sensitivity.

This mouse is useless with the current ghub limitations. A definite do not buy until lgs supports this or until ghub is fixed."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","I saw a few others mention this but disregarded it; sadly this was a bad call. Bought the mouse to play Escape from Tarkov and it is unplayable. When tapping the right mouse button (to aim) it double-clicks about 50% of the time, causing you to aim down sights then immediately stop. This means if you suddenly need to aim because you encounter another player, it'll cause you to stutter when aiming and will delay things by a few seconds, which is ample enough time for the other player to kill you. After several frustrating deaths I had to go back to my wired G502 which works perfectly with the same game. (for those who know the game, I DID try to set ""aim"" to ""continuous"" and I still had the same problem."

The scroll wheel, when on the click setting, feels heavy and stiff and like it will break any minute. The left/right buttons don't inspire confidence either.
The worst thing though is that, when I tried to program it in G Hub, it would lock up and I'd have to force-close G Hub to get back out. I've used G Hub for a long time with a keyboard and had no problems so the problem must be with the mouse.

I currently own the G502, G502 Lightspeed, G910 keyboard, G933 headset, and Powerplay Mousepad.

I have a pretty dang good computer but the second I open the software my CPU maxes out to 99% usage, everything in the program is non-responsive and it will just infuriate you.

The mouse is pretty awesome but I got the double click issue in less than 2 months.

I have uploaded a video, and you need to turn on the volume to hear the sound of clicking and releasing the button. The issue happens at click 5-6, 13-14, 26-27, 42-43, 50-52 (triple click), 71-72, 74-75, 77-78, 92-93.

Scott W,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","Another update 1.5 years in
Along with the double click issue, I now also have the holding click not working issue, so the clicker on this sucker is apparently nearing its end. Sometimes can't drag a window or content as it stops the click press. You can know you have this issue because the mouse has a click sound both when pressed and depressed, so if it stops dragging and then you release the click, you hear the sound. What a waste. Good while it worked. No more expensive Logitech stuff for me.

Updated: Less than a year in
I finally started experiencing the dreaded double click when single clicking. It happens just enough to cause me grief at times. Definitely my last Logitech mouse as they seem very prone to this. After spending $$ on the mouse and wireless pad, this mouse ended up costing a good chunk to not even last a year. I do like the comfort with the wireless. Buyer beware.

Updated: 5 months later
While this mouse is about the same as all Logitech mice I've ever owned (more than I can recall), it ends up about the same as every one of them. It is extremely prone to gathering crude on the bottom side of the mouse. More so than any others I've owned (Razer, Steel, several other brands). It is as if they think the underside of the mouse should be pretty, with different designs and indents. My cat likes to use my mouse pad as her resting spot and dogs are flying around with plenty of hair in the breeze. I think about all of it collects under this mouse better than my air purifier. I'm constantly having to clean it since it grabs everything due to poor underside smoothness. Maybe if I used it in a sterile environment?

Otherwise, the charging, along with Logitech's charge pad, has been working great. It stays charged between 85 and 95%. I worked around the changing DPI when the mouse sleeps by setting up an offline profile on the mouse that matched my normal DPI usage. Then turned off the offline mode. It appears that when the mouse sleeps, it defaults to the offline DPI, so you get that pause of difference each time you start using the mouse.

Probably my last attempt with Logitech. I'll probably try replacing the feet and maybe just smearing some silicon across the bottom parts to see if I can reduce it's pickup of hair and stuff.

Original:
I've owned too many Logitech mice to count over the years - other G502 models, G500 and on. For many years, the G500 was my go to. I think they stopped making it because, well, you apparently just have to keep changing things so you can market something different. At any rate, my last G502 Proteus suffered the same fate of many mice today where the clicker stopped functioning correctly, which of course kind of defeats the purpose of the mouse. This G502 Lightspeed is basically the same mouse as far as I can tell. Maybe a little better tracking, although I never had issues with mice that did half what the advertised tracking is today on these.

I had switched over and tried Razor, Steel and a few other with little to no success. They were either made of cheap parts (plastic/glue that eventually smudged all over) or had similar click issue. Since no company seems capable of producing quality products in 2021, I went back to Logitech.

If you like a bigger size mouse that has weight to it, this is your mouse. After trying other mice that were smaller and 2/3 of less the weight of this mouse, I realized that long term use of a small, light mouse isn't for me. My hand would cramp and my forearm would ache. I also missed the thumb holder of all things.

There are still some flaws in the design of this mouse. I don't know what kind of thumb you should be born with to use all the buttons correctly. If you palm the mouse, you need a thumb long as a finger to easily reach the front thumb buttons. If you claw grip, you need to bend your thumb backwards since you're over shooting the back buttons. You get used to shifting your hand around on it, although it makes for awkward motion and unsteady handling of the mouse when you're trying to be precise. The other buttons are about what you'd expect - feel the same as any other Logitech mouse I've owned.

The mouse wheel is a mixed bag. I like the grip they used on it as other mice often have some texture that doesn't feel that good for the finger. You can switch from free spin to the notched spin where you get tactical feel as you scroll. The free spin is nice, although it's a little too free. I thought I remembered prior versions not being as loose. In any software where you could go scroll happy, the free spin may spin when you don't expect it to or you can accidentally spin a bit as you reposition your fingers for that dang thumb button. I've ended up keep the tactical feel spin set, which is ok.

Given it's a wireless mouse, I opted for the PowerPlay wireless pad to go with it. The downside, if you like a really heavy mouse, is that in order to work with PowerPlay, you have to take the weights out for the charging battery. That seems like yet another big oversight. I personally don't need the weights in it, so it didn't bother me one way or the other.

Without PowerPlay and the lights turned off, I was getting around 60 to 80 hours of charge. Kind of an odd range, although I'm guessing it just depended on how long it sat there in sleep mode when I wasn't using it. With the LEDs turned on, that dropped down closer to 30 to 40 hours. That's still pretty good. I'm not sure why you have lights on a mouse to begin with because, well, your hand is generally on it and you can't see those lights. I guess if you want fancy lights when you're not at your desk, it works ok.

With PowerPlay, the mouse stays charged and I seem to stay somewhere between 80 and 90% charge almost always. It appears to drain down and then charge up a bit to not wear out the battery. The two devices together are exactly what I was hoping for - a wireless mouse that didn't have a cord dragging around and a charger that didn't require me to remember to charge up every time I turned around. I'd highly recommend the pad to go with this.

One fault I've had with most Logitech and other brands is the textured grips and especially the multiple designs on the bottom of the mice. All those indentations are dirt magnets. Sure, they look nice. Maybe they add to the handling of the mouse in some small degree. Maybe it looks nicer than a smooth, plain surface. I'd gladly trade whatever advantages for a completely smooth, easy to clean mouse though. My cat thinks my mouse pad is a bed and the mouse itself a pillow, so I constantly have hair and just whatever body oils come off my hands onto the mouse over time. Cleaning is such a pain and when any hair or residue gets on the under side of the mouse, you'll notice it tracking oddly. I'm not a slob by any means - I'd have issues here regardless of wild vermin roaming the house.

Lastly is the software. Everything you have anymore wants to install some crap in your system tray. And from what I can tell, that software is what reminds your mouse what DPI you have it set to. So while the software works ok and I've not crashed or seen any issues out of it, the one thing that I have noticed is that the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes and soon as you start moving it instantly wakes up. There is a bit of lag between when the mouse wakes and the software sees it back alive. So the mouse is working instantly, although the DPI of the mouse is the factory default and not the custom setting. So there's this short bit of time where your DPI isn't what you think it is. Once the software realizes the mouse is awake, it tells it to change and things are good once again. Just annoying that they don't appear to save the settings on the mouse itself. Setup is a bit confusing at times with all the options, so I could have missed it.

Overall, the mouse works just like I expected. I was a little disappointed that this was almost a clone to the mouse I owned 5 or 6 years, although I like that mouse a lot, so that's ok. I'm pretty sure the wheel may be a little bit of downgrade and the sound of the clicks is a bit loud compared to some. It is very comfortable though and it felt like coming home after a couple days use. Being wireless, I'm about as happy as I could probably be, so I'd recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a wireless, heavier side, large mouse."
Mike,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","I'm trying really hard to like this mouse, I really am. I like its ergonomics, its features, and even the programmable macro buttons.

This is now the second time I've re-written this review because I was trying to be fair, but the connectivity for the mouse is just so bad, that I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone. Intermittently, the mouse will lose connection and try to 'interpolate' where the cursor should be based on the last direction it was moving. This results in very choppy movement even on low report rate. This has been happening on multiple computers with different Operating Systems (Windows 10, 11, Linux.) I tried numerous solutions around the internet, Such as:

*Cleaning the sensor
*Trying different mouse pads and surfaces
*Reinstalling Logitech's driver software
*Uninstalling the Logitech Drivers and using the onboard memory manager program instead
*Lowering the report rate down to 125Hz
*Used an extension cable to bring the receiver closer to the mouse, to a point it doesn't make sense to be wireless anymore.

I've even forgone the wireless aspect and connected it physically via USB Micro (Yes, this mouse which costs a hundred dollars in 2024, still uses USB Micro instead of C.) And the way Logitech engineers made this mouse, its annoying to try and connect physically. Sure, you may have a couple USB Micro cables still laying around, but do you have one that's thin enough? Because the female connection for USB Micro is so recessed into a narrow inset, most cables you have are probably too wide to fit in the inset. Sure, you can use the included cable but in my case it stopped working after 2 months of use. No clue why it had to be engineered this way, because I've used both an MX Master 2, and 3 and never had this design flaw.

None of these attempted solutions alleviated the fact my mouse has intermittent connection issues. I had a Logitech G604 wireless mouse and that too had the same problem: Intermittent choppy movement. I'm not sure whats going on at Logitech, but reading around online on forums, I'm not the only person having such an issue. It feels like the quality is going down, since this is the second mouse I've bought from Logi that costs over a hundred dollars, that ended up being unusable. And at this stage, its looking like I'm not going to be a returning customer.

Stay away like its the plague."
BC,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","TLDR: This is a great mouse that is ruined by bad switches

I have been waiting for the wireless version of this mouse for years, since the original came out. I was a bit put off by the price but when my MX Revolution finally broke beyond my ability to repair it, I decided to buy this.

At first I was a bit let down, I wasn't really used to a light mouse and I mistook that as a sign of poor quality. It took a couple days for me to really start to enjoy using it and after that I was hooked. It has the perfect shape for my hand, the button arrangement is easy for me to use and the lack of weight makes it very easy to move quickly or lift up to reposition without straining to keep a grip on it. The only thing I changed early on was to use some grip tape on the main buttons so I had more control. The battery life is good, it lasts longer than my MX battery did so I have no complaints about that. G-Hub is required to use it but once you have everything set up the way you want, you can store the settings to the mouse and uninstall it if it bothers you that much, I came from Setpoint so G-Hub doesn't seem that bad.

So why the 1 star review after all this good ? The switches, within 2 weeks of owning this mouse I was getting double clicks on the left mouse button, it started with just one every once and awhile but then it started to happen more and more often, at first I thought (hoped) it was the grip tape I added, so I removed it, no change. I did find that I could get it to work normally if I pressed down hard and held the mouse button for a bit longer than I normally would but that just isn't something I was willing to do every time. So I came here thinking I would exchange it for a new one but they are out of stock. Between that and the fact that I really like so much about this mouse I decided to fix it myself and keep it. I bought some Kaith red micro switches and replaced the two main mouse switches with them. This worked great and I now have a perfect mouse, but I shouldn't need to fix a new product. If I was the only person who had this experience I would chalk it up to one bad product out of millions and still give it a good review but so many others have the same double click issues that this is obviously a QC issue that needs to be resolved. Logitech, if you read this, please, please fix this issue. You have an amazing product that is being ruined by a couple of $.50 switches.

To anyone else having this issue, if you want to go the same route I went just search ""G502 Lightspeed Full Teardown / Switch Replacement"" and there is a Reddit post that walks you through what to do with pics, it's really very easy if you know how to solder. If anyone has any questions just ask here and I will be happy to add any info that is needed."
Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I've been a loyal Logitech buyer since mx518, but I can't anymore. This is now the 4th Logi mouse I've had with bad switches within 2 years, and now the sensor is going bad. It has been about 1 year of use on this one. I'm not RMA'ing these anymore, I'd just rather purchase something that is reliable.

There are some baffling quality choices they've made on these. Not only in the switches that seem to have an abhorrent fail rate, but in just the quality. I realize now that I've gotten an equivalent replacement from another brand how much actual garbage is here. The feet are baffling. they are the thickness and flexibility of electric tape. I use a hard mat and they started folding over within months. The one around the sensor has a gap. since this is also recessed a bit (not the case on the new different-brand mouse) it's like it's begging to collect the most garbage possible. Which made the initial sensor issues so frustrating to figure out until it got overt. I couldn't tell if a random hair or something just got in there. It also makes an audible loose shake when you move it quickly right out of the box. That just feels and sounds bad. The switches all have a squishy actuation to them that feel imprecise.

I have large hands, so even though the size feels ok, the placement of the dpi switches are impossible to not smash mid-match at key times. mileage may vary there.

I had a lot of people recommend the 502 after the other high-end logi models I had already replaced. So the seem popular. But this was my last try with Logitech. I don't know how you charge this much for hardware like this.

Also of mention: the software, G-hub, though it looked fine, was functionally kind of a nightmare. and especially with other Logi peripherals. before replacing this, support had put forth that maybe closing the mouse's own software while running games would stop the sensor issue. that was actually the exact point where I just laughed, pulled up an amazon tab and bought a different brand. and so far, that was a fantastic decision."
Thomas Cederlof,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I'm so sick of people praising Logitech support. They are so SO bad at their customer support. Which is a shame, because usually their physical product is good but half the time there's is some small flaw that causes their products (whether it's mouse, keyboard or headset). Wouldn't be as much of a problem if it happens within the first 30 days through Amazon to get a replacement. But the minute you have to go through the Logitech Customer Support just consider yourself screwed (you ain't getting a replacement back). Their website and customer support is so backwards and convoluted it's almost like it's on purpose. It worked okay when I first bought, then as soon as I can't do an Amazon return, *POOF* it just fails to connect or turn on. Then you refer to their official FAQ, Reddit and random Google searches to troubleshoot. Nothing works. So you try to create a ticket, you tell them that you tried everything multiple times with nothing fixing it, yet Logitech Customer Support websites keep requiring you to login, then they refer you to the FAQ like 100 times, then to a AI chatbot where you have to say ""NOT HELPFUL"" to every same ""solution"" you've already read and tried 100 times. Then when you get a ""live chat agent"", they ask the SAME QUESTIONS, AGAIN, but spanned out over a 45 minute time waste. Then they say ""Give us your Name and Address, we will create a ticket number and email you. Then you get the email, with no information other then a ticket number they tell you refer but it literally doesn't exist on your account options or anything on their website. So you reply to the email and say just link me to the ticket, and their response is the LITERAL exact email that your responding too, but piled on that is them asking to refer to the FAQ and asking for your Name and address yet again as if they just didn't save that information. Do this over a few months and its like great, I've already done this 5-10 in this weird feed back loop when getting assistance can be easily done one time. Logitech SUCKS. Out of $115. These people suck so bad at customer support, so yeah if someone tells you that Logitech Support is good, they are dumb or lying. Keep that in mind."

When it comes to the Logitech Program... its annoying AF.

Update:
12/5/2019

The double-clicking has gotten really noticeable. Not bad enough it affects me in FPS games cause I am just shootings. I do notice it when using google and I double click things. Happens 1/20 or sometimes more or less. Its sad the mouse is not as good as the wired version. I have 5 of the wired versions for my desktop, laptop, traveling, work, and at my other home. The mouse otherwise is great other than sometimes it losing the profile I am on or not being detected in the GHUB which is a GHUB issue and always has been unless you use wired. I take that back cause it has even lost my speakers and my keyboard that is wired. The GHUB program is a terrible man. I wouldn't use it but for the G502 Light Speed you cant use the old software that is simple and has no issues. I have thought about switching back to the old wired G502 and gaming back to the old program, but I will wait until I get the point where I can't stand the double-clicking. Most other games from FPS I normally use a controller for RPG, sports, or racing games. GHUB is terrible. Don't even get me started about that stupid program or just google all the issues people have had with it. I once had to reformat my computer to get it uninstalled so I could reinstall it to get it to update because the update froze as it does for a lot of people and the ways to fix it were not working like normal. I would not use this mouse. The price is high but so are all really nice things and the double-clicking and software which I think is the worse part I would not buy right now."
Tim Bohrer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Mouse jumps around a lot, it is easily the best mouse I have ever had. Yet, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. If you are moving the mouse even if you aren't touching the scroll wheel it will jump around and move on its own. Kinda insane because you can't scroll through webpages, or play games that utilize the mouse wheel. The worst part is that there isn't a fix for it other than ""firmware update"" which I am up to date.

Seems simple enough to program the mouse to ignore oposite rolling unless rolling for more than 2 or 3 clicks or what ever... Seems even easier to give the custom program a sliding scale for sensitivity for the mouse, or any other mouse out there.

bahmtoll,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I would've given 0 Star if I could've.

I originally had G502 Hero (Wired) I liked it, so I ordered wireless one G502 Lightspeed with 25K HERO sensor.
When i received, I read the box since there are two different model for G502 Lightspeed.
One is old model with 16K sensor, newer model is with 25K sensor.
But on the box says 16K sensor. So checked the model number and serial number under the bottom cover of the mouse. It was shocking.

1) First, the number on the box were stickers covered original one. (I am not sure if the original one comes like that since i did not take it off. I needed to return.

2) The model number on the mouse was 810-006427 which was old model.
(Newer model number should be 910-005565)
The model number on the box has the newer model number.

3) I also checked serial number, the number on the box and the number on the bottom of the mouse did not match either.

I contacted AMAZON, and they said they were sorry and made the replacement taking 2 more days, guess what ?
The same thing happened.

And additionally, the replacement looks like it was used - checked the skid pad under the mouse.
The plastic cover was not in the correct way and skid pad was not fresh.
How can this happen with plastic sealed product ?

The Product Number and the serial number on the box were stickers. I don't know actual product was made like that. But what I know is they came with plastic covers which were sealed.

At this point, I don't know what to do. returning and getting a replacement will make the same thing happen again for sure because AMAZON will not be able to open the box before shipping to check.
even if they do, that means I am going to receive opened box.

The worst experience ever."
Vladislav,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I bought two of these for $163 each, and I just had to throw away mine. Yes, it lasted for about 4-5 years or so, but it's not enough when a mouse costs like three very good mice. I had to replace my older top-end Logitech mouse for the exact same reason. They've known about the issue, but they wouldn't start using different switches. It makes them money at the end of the day. Reviewers never mention this in video reviews either because they get paid, so you'll find out about it later. I'd recommend going for the cheaper version for $40. It's the ""G502 HERO"" wired version. It's WAY worth $40. The mouse is amazing.

I have to say this Hero sensor is the best sensor I've ever seen in a mouse. The mouse is amazing in all other aspects. The movement is precise, and I definitely started enjoying FPS games way more. You always feel in control, and aiming is just so much fun."

M. Chase Masters,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","Logitech's higher end mice: G903 Lightspeed and the G502 Lightspeed have a common problem: double-clicking. Over a short period of time, it can get very aggravating.

I bought both models, one for me and one for my girlfriend. In several months both acquired the double click problem from their ""Omron"" switches Logitech uses. So my mice are under warranty, right? So I put in a ticket on Logitech's site (which that alone is confusing) and days later I receive canned emails asking me to go through endless troubleshooting steps, which I did. Days later I received an email asking me to record videos with my smartphone camera of the mouse, it's serial number, and a handwritten note with the case number, provide a copy of my receipt, record another video of their ""double click"" test and upload all of this to a Google Drive folder and provide them the link to it.

I do all this. I then receive an email from their technical support telling me they need to inspect my mouse. So after all that, they want me to stick the mouse in a box and ship it to them. Of course, this is simply to try and wear you out, so you give up.

Take my word for it, if you are a gamer do not buy these mice. I'd suggest the Razer mice that come with their optical switches. They last longer than Logitech's mechanical, and they are also less prone to Logitech's double-clicking nightmares."
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","I bought this to replace my previous wired g502 mouse. The new Logitech software for managing the mouse is absolutely garbage. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen constantly, where I have to go into task manager and quit every related process, then restart the software. This happens whenever my computer disconnects from a network connection as well. Anytime I lose network connection, the Ghub software goes back to the infinite loading screen glitch. I game on my laptop a lot and I will connect to a hotspot occasionally, then disconnect when I'm done. Every time network changes happen it bricks there GHub app, forcing me to quit all processes, etc. It makes it so anytime I change network settings I have to go through a 5 minute process to get my mouse working again. And this seems to be a known issue, with several forums throughout reddit, Logitech website, etc, yet the do nothing to resolve it. I can't recommend this mouse to anyone with this problems."
Matthew Fintonis,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I've been using Logitech mice for a long time, and I've loved every single one including the G502. It's amazing to use with the powerplay mouse pad and have a wireless mouse that never has to be recharged. However, there has been a recurring theme with these mice and that is the infamous double click issue. Before my G502, I had a G900 that I had for a couple years that never experienced this issue. I eventually had to replace that one though because the battery stopped holding a charge. I then got the G903, theoretically the same identical mouse but also supported the then new powerplay mousepad. Well, I went through THREE of them and they all started producing a double click issue after only a couple months after purchase. I thought maybe there was something wrong with that model so I ended up purchasing the G502. Well, I bought it back in March and it's only July and guess what? Double-clicking issue is showing up already. Logitech, you make great products, but this double click issue is now in so many of your mice that I can no longer recommend your brand to my friends and I can no longer trust Logitech peripherals. Even if it wasn't for the switch issue, the software you created, Logitech G Hub, is the most atrocious piece of software I have ever used. It seemingly only wants to work half the time with most of the time it just failing to launch without a complete uninstall and reinstall. Logitech, you need to step up your game with your quality assurance and your software development if you want to compete in this crowded market."
melissa lee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021","when i got the sealed box i was excited to open it. at first glance i immediately noticed particles in the box youd expect to see in a used open box product or something you leave open for a couple nights to allow to collect those particles. idk what conditions the logitech packaging warehouse are in, so i kept going with a positive mindset. i then noticed a SCUFF on the side of the mouse that one might overlook under different lighting conditions or can easily be overlooked in general, not bad at all if i had done it myself, but i hadnt even touched the mouse at that point, i tried to recreate the scuff and the closest i could get was using my fingernail and pressing in extremely hard, so whoever made the scuff had to drop it or something drastic to even get that as a permanent scuff. i kept going now extremely disappointed and pissed, i found tiny things that look like hairs, but i wasnt convinced until i reached the included metal weights...fingerprints on them. not mine, i still havent touched the weights, these prints again could be overlooked under different lighting conditions, my window just so happened to be the perfect light factor to show them. i can see how someone trying to repackage it would think they did a great job, but you just cant deny the prints. dissatisfied with my NEW purchase showing multiple signs of being used; if i wanted it used i wouldve saved the money and bought it used. just go to best buy or some brick and mortar store to pick yours up."

Chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","Im a huge Logitech fan and have been for most of my life.. but I paid $100 to add a peripheral that made my life harder than before. I understand that gaming mice are supposed to have extra features, and with that comes more complexity. The software just doesn’t work as intended, there are many times that I had to reconfigure my mouse to make sure I could move the pointer more than 1 inch on the screen every time I woke my Pc up. It’s annoying that the software has to load before the mouse actually works as intended, but even then the settings won’t save. I’ve done the research to try and fix it. But I shouldn’t have to *think* and *work* to get my mouse to do what it’s supposed to do. Save your time and money like I wish I did."
Jacob Smith,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","The mouse itself seems to be a great product, but the accompanying app, Logitech G-Hub, which you use to customize the mouse itself and the button layout, is an absolute nightmare. It is confusing, frustrating, and is not user friendly. It automatically switches profiles without your consent, which is annoying if you want to have a personalized profile while playing a game. Maybe there is something that I am missing, but the G-Hub has no tutorial, and after hours of trying to figure it out and searching the web for help, I've decided to return this item. My Razer Basilisk never had any issues, and the corresponding app was so easy my aged grandmother could figure it out."
Firefly,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Mouse is a piece of Junk. Like many others, mine started acting up after 2 days. DPI control buttons wouldn't toggle. Mouse would randomly change DPI. When I started my PC in the morning, mouse would lag, and I had to reboot to get it to stop. GHUB software is the absolute worst piece of crap software ever, especially if you plan to use a Powerplay mat. I originally had a G903 Lightspeed but wanted to switch to this for the design profile.

Especially with the Powerplay mat, if you already have a mouse paired with it, it is impossible to remove an old mouse and pair with a new mouse using GHUB. You literally have to uninstall GHUB, and install the older LGS software (better download it now before it becomes unavailable). Then use the LGS software to put the Powerplay mat back into pairing mode. You then pair the new mouse with the Powerplay mat. Once done though, your mouse will work, but you cannot customize anything on the mouse with the LGS software. You then have to uninstall it, and reinstall GHUB. It only took me 2 weeks to find this solution on the internet and it most definitely was not on the Logitech support site.

I had to go through this twice. First to install the G502, and again to reinstall my G903 which is working perfectly."
brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","To begin, I feel compelled to automatically take 2 possible stars away from this product due to the ludicrous price tag that is attached. There is no reason this mouse should cost $149, it is comparable to tons of wireless mice in lower price ranges. This bugs me to start, especially considering the wired version is $49 - pretty sure it shouldn't cost $100 to remove a cable.

That said, the wired version of this mouse is arguably my favorite productivity/gaming mouse in recent memory. The downside was that the cable was terrible (frays, fabric gets caught on everything, etc.). I decided after much time to just pull the trigger on the wireless version, hoping this would fulfill my needs for quite some time.

Safe to say it... did not.

Laughably, the mouse did not work correctly out of the box. Apparently they did not put that extra $100 toward making a quality mouse either. The DPI Shift button, with and without the new logitech software, constantly becomes 'stuck' inputting anywhere from 2 - 50 inputs each time it is clicked. I typically remap this button to something other than DPI shift and have not had this problem with either of the two wired-versions of this mouse I have had, but this problem was persistent to the point where the button was unusable.

TLDR; Absolutely do not spend $150 on this mouse. The wired version is ~$49, and there are many reasonably priced wireless mice otherwise. Most of those probably even work out of the box! (hopefully)"
Alice M. Videlock,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","Initially I thought it was due to a driver issue, I'd click and sometimes it would click twice.
So I tried uninstalling the HID mouse driver, reinstalling, restarting. Same issue.
Then I thought maybe it was the brand new computer I built, so I tried my work computer. Same issue. Tried my old computer. Same issue. Tried my parents computer. Same. Issue.
This is coming from a mouse that had a similar problem - the g703. That mouse started with issues, but somehow fixed itself. I'd still once in a while have a double click here or there, but it was so infrequent that I paid it no mind. Eventually, after 6 years of use it just hit a point where I couldn't click and drag, it'd just continuously click forever.
I deemed it dead, and decided I liked the features of the mouse too much to give up on logitech, surely I wouldn't get similar issues with a new model?

I was wrong.

Three days in the issue happened instantly. On mouse down, click. Part of the way up (before you here the click) the mouse would just start detecting clicks multiple times a second.

I know there are ways to fix it and clean it, but that's not what I'm paying for. I don't want to open the mouse to have to fix something that should just work.

I'm sorry logitech, this is just shameful, and with these issues being so longstanding I just can't go with your products ever again."

thunder2132,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2019","If this mouse works, it's pretty fantastic. I like the layout, it's quick as heck, fairly lightweight for a wireless mouse, and the software, though not what I prefer, works fine for me.

What killed the mouse for me was the dreaded Logitech double-click issue. Less than two days after the item arrived every click was detected as a double-click. It'd click once on the downstroke, and click again on the release. It wasn't dropped, and is in a clean environment. I thought it might be software related, so I removed all Logitech software, uninstalled/cleaned the drivers, and even tried in Linux and in Safe Mode, the problem was still there.

So, it's getting returned, and for $150 I'm not going to gamble on another one.

Update

Ok, so I didn't take my own advice, and I gambled on a second one. I loved this mouse while it was working, it did everything I wanted extremely well, and I figured maybe I just got a lemon. The second one arrived last week, and stopped working last night. Same issues with the left click always detecting as a double-click. You can fix it with new switches, but that involves soldering, and ordering more parts for a $150 mouse. Strongly recommend just staying away entirely, don't gamble like I did."

Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Bought this during a sale for $99. Received the mouse and checked the box for SN and model number, everything looked good. Box appeared to have the original clear plastic wrap, so it wasn't a return or anything. Opened it up, started to charge it and add the custom weights and noticed the SN and the model number were different than what was on the box. The model number that was on the mouse was 810-006427 and on the box was 910-005565. I did some research and the mouse with the 810 model number does NOT have the 25k sensor. So I reached out to Logitech directly and they told me that they couldn't find the serial number in there system and it's likely that this is not a legitimate G502. So processes a return to get it replaced. For the second mouse I had the same problem, box looked new and unopened, but the SN and model on the box was completely different that what the actual mouse had on it. I returned this one as well and ordered directly from the Logitech website. I would not suggest buying this from here (even though it's through the Logitech storefront)"
vibe,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","First of all, the mouse feels small (I wear size L gloves FWIW) compared to the Logitech MX Master 3 and the tiny buttons are placed very close to each other in places where it's very easy to accidentally press. Speaking of buttons, the two buttons directly adjacent to the left of the Left mouse button was one of my biggest frustrations with this device. You cannot remap or disable this button. The default is the DPI increase or decrease setting. When you are gaming or just casually browsing and you accidentally press this button, suddenly the mouse sensitivity is drastically changed. Even when you try to disable these buttons for 'Desktop' and for specific games, it will still adjust the DPI settings.

I really tried to like this mouse despite the bad ergonomics but those two buttons mapped to DPI settings is what made this unusable for me."

Why is it either rock hard and hurts your finger or so loose you will be scrolling all over the place accidentally? Rough on the finger to the point that it hurts. If you bind the middle click to anything it will not be a good time for your finger.

Also why does this mouse not have a physical LED on and off switch? When your computer is on you can disable the annoying lights, then when your PC is off it resets back to its LGB RAINBOW VERY BRIGHT MODE. I wonder why the batteries drain so fast?....

Also no notification if you have the software and drivers that the batteries are low, it just dies. Bad mouse

The large dpi adjustment buttons next to your index finger are also pointless and get in the way. Why would i need to adjust dpi on the fly. Makes no sense. The scroll wheel feels kinda chunky.

D. Lackey,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","This mouse looks wonderful, feels wonderful, and the battery life is incredible. Even with heavy use, I might have to charge it once every two weeks. I'm hit or miss regarding the software it comes with but for the most part it's a great mouse with a terrible, terrible (quite literally) game breaking flaw.

The problem is that the switches in this mouse are trash and they will die on you, probably sooner rather than later. My first one lasted maybe a month or two tops before the right click and middle click ceased functioning properly. To Logitech's credit, customer service did promptly issue a replacement, no questions asked, no additional charges applied. The second mouse lasted a little longer but again those exact same issues propped up.

I play a very Final Fantastical MMO and rely on middle mouse for Discord and right click for camera and movement, so when BOTH of these go haywire it's not only frustrating but potentially detrimental to the group I play with.

For casual use I could see this being an incredible mouse, but for gaming it falls short and falls short quickly. We recently picked the Razer Basilisk Ultimate (Wireless) instead and that's been a solid replacement. The G502 has been a disappointment and I'll probably be wary of Logitech mice from here on out."

Nope. I bought this specifically for the on board memory for situations where I can't install or am not allowed admin access. It's a nightmare. I'm a savvy guy but this is really a marvel of convoluted UI. To make matters worse, the documentation is almost non-existent.

Mac users: I'll add that I tried to install G-hub on a Mac and it failed. Flat out failed. I tried to uninstall and reinstall... Fail. I even manually deleted the libraries. Never got it to work.

Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022","Beware, there is a known right click issue with this model. Mine presented itself 2 months outside of the warranty. I emailed Logitech and they told me I was out of luck and suggested 3!! different times that I should buy their latest model.

Its a $2 switch, and about 15 minute repair time.

The problem with the switch is that it builds up static electricity. Literally blowing under the right click fin/face, allowing some humidity in, will discharge the static build up for the time being.

But, you'll be happy to know Logitech was very pleased to hear I was able to repair it myself. This was their top of the line model when I purchased it, and they were unable to stand behind their bad hardware/design decisions. Buy something else."

Ryan H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","This is perhaps one of the worst mouse I have ever purchased in 30 years of pc gaming. I originally bought the 502 in August 2020 to replace a beloved 602 that was out of stock/discontinued? The issue with the 602 was the switch mechanism on the left mouse button failed after about 2 years. The 502 seems to suffer from the same quality issues as the rest of Logitech's current generation of gaming mice. I got 6 months out of this mouse and I'm already looking for a replacement. So what else is wrong with this mouse? Don't believe this review? Just google Logitech switch and double clicking.

The battery life is abysmal. Be prepared to plug it in every 2 weeks. Compared to the 602 with a pair of AA rechargeable that last 2-3 months.

The body is too small. Compared to the 602 this thing is narrow and light. If you have larger hands you'll likely experience pinky drag.

Except, the first one I bought had a double click issue with the right mouse button. About 1 in 20 times when you click the right mouse button, it would double click instead of single click. So, a lemon, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon.

The second one had a little bit of double click on the left mouse button. About 1 in 500 times, it was pretty rare, so while I was upset that a $120-$150 mouse had an issue like that at all, I could live with it. About two months in, the left click issue got much worse. Now it's about 1 in 8 clicks the left mouse button double clicks, and when I hold left click to drag something around, the mouse frequently ""releases"" the click on its own.

It is a heavy mouse which I don’t prefer but it’s overall a good mouse. After a year of use for casual gaming, I’ve began noticing significant issues with the M1 (left click) switch. It will occasionally doubly click or not register clicks. This is very frustrating when you are trying to spam through smokes in a game like valorant or buy a frenzy first round. You hold down M1 to spray and it shoots one bullet then stops, then you let off and press again and nothing. It’s very frustrating and expected more out of a 150 dollar mouse.

James,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2021","I wouldn’t normally give a product a one star for having to be replaced as I know flaws can happen from time to time and I have worked in tech support for years now but.... I have had to have this specific mouse replaced twice now and the same issue confuses to happen.

After only a few months of moderate gaming, the mouse clicks will start to let go randomly making games that you have to hold down a mouse click near impossible to play.

I know this is a different product but it is from Logitech as well. I have had to have two different model headsets replaced because they eventually will start to randomly disconnect or get start. The most recent one was only replaced a few weeks ago and right off the bat I am getting electrical static as if there is an electrical short in the wiring.

I don’t plan on buy another Logitech device ever again."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","As many others have said, switches lasted about 6 months, then I started getting the double click issue and I was unable to drag items consistently. This is the end of life you can expect for this mouse that only varies with how often you are clicking. The short of it is that Logitech made a money saving decision to switch to a different, cheaper switch manufacturer years back and the last couple of generations of their mouse last only as long as the the left click switch lasts. They have had plenty of time to evaluate and fix the issue and they have decided it makes more business sense to save money on the switches. To be clear, this is no longer a quality brand and should be avoided. Customer service is a nightmare asking you to go through two dozen troubleshooting steps to fix the issue, then they are unresponsive when you have completed those steps and are ready to ship it back to them."
Crusty Chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","Imagine... you're using your G502, but except that annoying slight tug of the wire isn't there anymore. You are free, like a man urinating off the side of the grand canyon. You feel the wind between your legs. Free to aim where ever you'd like :)

Also the battery lasts forever in this thing (I keep all the LEDs off fyi). I'm tempted to believe this thing runs on nuclear power because I've definitely used it every day for a week or slightly longer without charging it with no issues.

UPDATE: The switches are faulty. Had the middle mouse button fail so I got a replacement, the middle mouse button failed again. Along with the right mouse button. Logitech does not honor a full warranty on replacement mice. Only the period of the warranty that applies to the original product. This is a fault product and not worth buying in my experience."
bryan newby,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019","The mouse/software constantly loses the key binds that have been set. They still display in the settings as set, they just don't work. Shutting the software down and restarting it doesn't do anything, rebooting the PC will cause it to work again (which I would think points more to a software than a mechanical issue). Add to this, the new maintenance software, G Hub, has one of the worst UI's I have ever seen. It is so complicated, convoluted, non-intuitive, and features like auto-switching profiles based on what application has active focus, are not what I want and they are not easily turned off. When you have to search for 'how do I do X' for your peripheral configuration app, there's a problem. Old software was simple, easy to use, never had to think about it. G Hub is the opposite of that. You cannot install the old software with this mouse, you're stuck with G Hub."
BradB,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","Battery life is nowhere near “40 hours” as the software states with RGB off.

Speaking of battery. When in wireless mode mouse will not auto off or sleep when pc is in sleep mode or off. So if you forget to turn the mouse off before bed congratulations you just lost all those hours of battery life.

Sometimes it immediately sets itself back to the DPI you want on system reboot. Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes for the software to catch up. Meanwhile you’re stuck at the default 400dpi or whatever it is.

Small for my hands.

It’s a return for me. Hopefully others have better luck."
Delinquent,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","The required G Hub software for configuring the mouse is dysfunctional. It's the worst piece of software I've dealt with in years. One excellent capability of this mouse is having 11 so-called programmable buttons. I've had a Logitech Performance MX mouse for a decade and it's easy to program a button using the older Logitech software. Let's say you want to have a button automatically close a window on the Mac. Any reasonable software would let you assign the command+w keystroks combo to a button and you are done. The brilliant G Hub software only lets you assign a single key, in this case either command or w but not the combo. So you cannot program a button for this simple action. That's just doesn't serve customers very well. And third party Mac software doesn't work with this mouse. Spare yourself headaches."

Alex,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","DO NOT BUY!

To begin with, my mouse developed the double clicking issue that these mice are becoming famous for. When I sent it in for warranty service, I thought I'd be getting my overpriced mouse back in a few days. It's now been over a month and STILL NO MOUSE. No clue how it could possibly take this long to provide me a replacement. I've emailed them multiple times, opened an additional ticket, and still have NO MOUSE.

Please, don't make the mistake I did and waste $150 on this worthless mouse. When it works, it's just fine. When it inevitably breaks from basic use, don't count on Logitech standing by their warranty. What a massive waste of money and time. I've always bought Logitech mice in the past, but certainly didn't go with them for my replacement."
Shehab S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021","UPDATE 2: Opposite to what I would expect, no immediate customer support from Logitech. I have been going through links to find the proper customer support for my issue. This might cause me to refrain buy or even recommend the brand in the future.
UPDATE: 1 Star!! For such an expensive mouse, I am surprised that of all issues, this is what I came across. The right-click button is either too sensitive or broken. It clicks too fast (or two times) when gently clicked. That has caused an issue for me during gameplay and photo-editing.

This mouse rocks dude! Definitely was worth the switch (from razer atheris). The app made for the mouse is much better than razer's."
L. Thompson,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","I'd worn out the rubber grips on my MX Master again, so went to replace it and hopefully upgrade, but this mouse, while looking snazzy, is definitely NOT an upgrade - it's fine for normal mousing, but I've got slightly larger hands and this mouse is very light (even with all the weights in), and feels ""flimsy"", plus the scrollwheel doesn't have an easily-pressed freescroll button like the MX Master does. It feels like it's made for younger users who don't know that there's a better version out there, and it's more expensive to boot.

I'll keep it for an emergency backup mouse, but I'm going to buy another MX Master to replace my old one."
Kevin Dou,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Upgrading from the wired g502. The mouse itself is great but lgs no longer supports the lightspeed. Instead you are forced to use the buggy ghub software. The current software has connection problems that can be fixed occasionally by restarting the software or the computer, but will also frequently default the programmable buttons to their default function. I’ve programmed several buttons which I use for mmo and dps gaming, and when the software allows the mouse to function properly, it works great, just like my old wired g502. When it doesn’t, the two index buttons on the left of left click will default to dpi up and down, randomly changing my sensitivity.

This mouse is useless with the current ghub limitations. A definite do not buy until lgs supports this or until ghub is fixed."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","I saw a few others mention this but disregarded it; sadly this was a bad call. Bought the mouse to play Escape from Tarkov and it is unplayable. When tapping the right mouse button (to aim) it double-clicks about 50% of the time, causing you to aim down sights then immediately stop. This means if you suddenly need to aim because you encounter another player, it'll cause you to stutter when aiming and will delay things by a few seconds, which is ample enough time for the other player to kill you. After several frustrating deaths I had to go back to my wired G502 which works perfectly with the same game. (for those who know the game, I DID try to set ""aim"" to ""continuous"" and I still had the same problem."

RAHAlpha,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","I read reviews and watched them on YouTube and I thought this was going to be a great mouse. Don't believe everything your read or watch. The whole thing feels like cheap plastic; like a low end one might. The scroll wheel, when on the click setting, feels heavy and stiff and like it will break any minute. The left/right buttons don't inspire confidence either.
The worst thing though is that, when I tried to program it in G Hub, it would lock up and I'd have to force-close G Hub to get back out. I've used G Hub for a long time with a keyboard and had no problems so the problem must be with the mouse.
Bottom line: Not recommended (But maybe you'd think differently)."

I feel like I was scammed out of my money using this product... and am just paying Logitech's marketing team. If you want a mouse good for gaming, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. You will spend hours and hours just trying to fix settings trying to find a reason to not blame the mouse, to ultimately conclude you have a literal piece of poop in your hands."
Cullen,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020","After a very short period time of using this mouse, it had already developed a major issue when it comes to gaming. The right-click button on the mouse will not hold even when you are physically holding the button down, instead, the holding of the button causing an awkward pulsing of the signal like the button/sensor has gone bad already (this happened within 3-4 months of ownership). Seems to me like there is a hardware problem as when searching the forums there are plenty of other people with the same problem. I love the mouse and the ergonomics, but with such a horrible hardware issue there is no way I can suggest this mouse to others."

If you're not familiar, after some wear (hardly any in my case) some of these mice will start doubling the click inputs and repeating them if the button is held. It is fantastically annoying.

I currently own the G502, G502 Lightspeed, G910 keyboard, G933 headset, and Powerplay Mousepad. The only reason I am giving this a one star is because of the software needed to download to program the mouse. I have a pretty dang good computer but the second I open the software my CPU maxes out to 99% usage, everything in the program is non-responsive and it will just infuriate you. If G-hub sticks aroud I will never by a Logitech accessory again. If they make G-hub not pull your hair out bad I would switch this to 5 stars."
XYSD,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020","I wish I have read the 1-star review before buying the mouse. The mouse is pretty awesome but I got the double click issue in less than 2 months. Upon closer look, it seems that both clicking the left button and releasing the button may register a separate click event, which seems to be fairly common and discussed in reddit and other forums too. I have uploaded a video, and you need to turn on the volume to hear the sound of clicking and releasing the button. The issue happens at click 5-6, 13-14, 26-27, 42-43, 50-52 (triple click), 71-72, 74-75, 77-78, 92-93.

Scott W,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","Another update 1.5 years in
Along with the double click issue, I now also have the holding click not working issue, so the clicker on this sucker is apparently nearing its end. Sometimes can't drag a window or content as it stops the click press. You can know you have this issue because the mouse has a click sound both when pressed and depressed, so if it stops dragging and then you release the click, you hear the sound. What a waste. Good while it worked. No more expensive Logitech stuff for me.

Updated: Less than a year in
I finally started experiencing the dreaded double click when single clicking. It happens just enough to cause me grief at times. Definitely my last Logitech mouse as they seem very prone to this. After spending $$ on the mouse and wireless pad, this mouse ended up costing a good chunk to not even last a year. I do like the comfort with the wireless. Buyer beware.

Updated: 5 months later
While this mouse is about the same as all Logitech mice I've ever owned (more than I can recall), it ends up about the same as every one of them. It is extremely prone to gathering crude on the bottom side of the mouse. More so than any others I've owned (Razer, Steel, several other brands). It is as if they think the underside of the mouse should be pretty, with different designs and indents. My cat likes to use my mouse pad as her resting spot and dogs are flying around with plenty of hair in the breeze. I think about all of it collects under this mouse better than my air purifier. I'm constantly having to clean it since it grabs everything due to poor underside smoothness. Maybe if I used it in a sterile environment?

Otherwise, the charging, along with Logitech's charge pad, has been working great. It stays charged between 85 and 95%. I worked around the changing DPI when the mouse sleeps by setting up an offline profile on the mouse that matched my normal DPI usage. Then turned off the offline mode. It appears that when the mouse sleeps, it defaults to the offline DPI, so you get that pause of difference each time you start using the mouse.

Probably my last attempt with Logitech. I'll probably try replacing the feet and maybe just smearing some silicon across the bottom parts to see if I can reduce it's pickup of hair and stuff.

Original:
I've owned too many Logitech mice to count over the years - other G502 models, G500 and on. For many years, the G500 was my go to. I think they stopped making it because, well, you apparently just have to keep changing things so you can market something different. At any rate, my last G502 Proteus suffered the same fate of many mice today where the clicker stopped functioning correctly, which of course kind of defeats the purpose of the mouse. This G502 Lightspeed is basically the same mouse as far as I can tell. Maybe a little better tracking, although I never had issues with mice that did half what the advertised tracking is today on these.

I had switched over and tried Razor, Steel and a few other with little to no success. They were either made of cheap parts (plastic/glue that eventually smudged all over) or had similar click issue. Since no company seems capable of producing quality products in 2021, I went back to Logitech.

If you like a bigger size mouse that has weight to it, this is your mouse. After trying other mice that were smaller and 2/3 of less the weight of this mouse, I realized that long term use of a small, light mouse isn't for me. My hand would cramp and my forearm would ache. I also missed the thumb holder of all things.

There are still some flaws in the design of this mouse. I don't know what kind of thumb you should be born with to use all the buttons correctly. If you palm the mouse, you need a thumb long as a finger to easily reach the front thumb buttons. If you claw grip, you need to bend your thumb backwards since you're over shooting the back buttons. You get used to shifting your hand around on it, although it makes for awkward motion and unsteady handling of the mouse when you're trying to be precise. The other buttons are about what you'd expect - feel the same as any other Logitech mouse I've owned.

The mouse wheel is a mixed bag. I like the grip they used on it as other mice often have some texture that doesn't feel that good for the finger. You can switch from free spin to the notched spin where you get tactical feel as you scroll. The free spin is nice, although it's a little too free. I thought I remembered prior versions not being as loose. In any software where you could go scroll happy, the free spin may spin when you don't expect it to or you can accidentally spin a bit as you reposition your fingers for that dang thumb button. I've ended up keep the tactical feel spin set, which is ok.

Given it's a wireless mouse, I opted for the PowerPlay wireless pad to go with it. The downside, if you like a really heavy mouse, is that in order to work with PowerPlay, you have to take the weights out for the charging battery. That seems like yet another big oversight. I personally don't need the weights in it, so it didn't bother me one way or the other.

Without PowerPlay and the lights turned off, I was getting around 60 to 80 hours of charge. Kind of an odd range, although I'm guessing it just depended on how long it sat there in sleep mode when I wasn't using it. With the LEDs turned on, that dropped down closer to 30 to 40 hours. That's still pretty good. I'm not sure why you have lights on a mouse to begin with because, well, your hand is generally on it and you can't see those lights. I guess if you want fancy lights when you're not at your desk, it works ok.

With PowerPlay, the mouse stays charged and I seem to stay somewhere between 80 and 90% charge almost always. It appears to drain down and then charge up a bit to not wear out the battery. The two devices together are exactly what I was hoping for - a wireless mouse that didn't have a cord dragging around and a charger that didn't require me to remember to charge up every time I turned around. I'd highly recommend the pad to go with this.

One fault I've had with most Logitech and other brands is the textured grips and especially the multiple designs on the bottom of the mice. All those indentations are dirt magnets. Sure, they look nice. Maybe they add to the handling of the mouse in some small degree. Maybe it looks nicer than a smooth, plain surface. I'd gladly trade whatever advantages for a completely smooth, easy to clean mouse though. My cat thinks my mouse pad is a bed and the mouse itself a pillow, so I constantly have hair and just whatever body oils come off my hands onto the mouse over time. Cleaning is such a pain and when any hair or residue gets on the under side of the mouse, you'll notice it tracking oddly. I'm not a slob by any means - I'd have issues here regardless of wild vermin roaming the house.

Lastly is the software. Everything you have anymore wants to install some crap in your system tray. And from what I can tell, that software is what reminds your mouse what DPI you have it set to. So while the software works ok and I've not crashed or seen any issues out of it, the one thing that I have noticed is that the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes and soon as you start moving it instantly wakes up. There is a bit of lag between when the mouse wakes and the software sees it back alive. So the mouse is working instantly, although the DPI of the mouse is the factory default and not the custom setting. So there's this short bit of time where your DPI isn't what you think it is. Once the software realizes the mouse is awake, it tells it to change and things are good once again. Just annoying that they don't appear to save the settings on the mouse itself. Setup is a bit confusing at times with all the options, so I could have missed it.

Overall, the mouse works just like I expected. I was a little disappointed that this was almost a clone to the mouse I owned 5 or 6 years, although I like that mouse a lot, so that's ok. I'm pretty sure the wheel may be a little bit of downgrade and the sound of the clicks is a bit loud compared to some. It is very comfortable though and it felt like coming home after a couple days use. Being wireless, I'm about as happy as I could probably be, so I'd recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a wireless, heavier side, large mouse."

This is now the second time I've re-written this review because I was trying to be fair, but the connectivity for the mouse is just so bad, that I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone. Intermittently, the mouse will lose connection and try to 'interpolate' where the cursor should be based on the last direction it was moving. This results in very choppy movement even on low report rate. This has been happening on multiple computers with different Operating Systems (Windows 10, 11, Linux.) I tried numerous solutions around the internet, Such as:

*Cleaning the sensor
*Trying different mouse pads and surfaces
*Reinstalling Logitech's driver software
*Uninstalling the Logitech Drivers and using the onboard memory manager program instead
*Lowering the report rate down to 125Hz
*Used an extension cable to bring the receiver closer to the mouse, to a point it doesn't make sense to be wireless anymore.

I've even forgone the wireless aspect and connected it physically via USB Micro (Yes, this mouse which costs a hundred dollars in 2024, still uses USB Micro instead of C.) And the way Logitech engineers made this mouse, its annoying to try and connect physically. Sure, you may have a couple USB Micro cables still laying around, but do you have one that's thin enough? Because the female connection for USB Micro is so recessed into a narrow inset, most cables you have are probably too wide to fit in the inset. Sure, you can use the included cable but in my case it stopped working after 2 months of use. No clue why it had to be engineered this way, because I've used both an MX Master 2, and 3 and never had this design flaw.

None of these attempted solutions alleviated the fact my mouse has intermittent connection issues. I had a Logitech G604 wireless mouse and that too had the same problem: Intermittent choppy movement. I'm not sure whats going on at Logitech, but reading around online on forums, I'm not the only person having such an issue.

BC,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","TLDR: This is a great mouse that is ruined by bad switches

I have been waiting for the wireless version of this mouse for years, since the original came out. I was a bit put off by the price but when my MX Revolution finally broke beyond my ability to repair it, I decided to buy this.

At first I was a bit let down, I wasn't really used to a light mouse and I mistook that as a sign of poor quality. It took a couple days for me to really start to enjoy using it and after that I was hooked. It has the perfect shape for my hand, the button arrangement is easy for me to use and the lack of weight makes it very easy to move quickly or lift up to reposition without straining to keep a grip on it. The only thing I changed early on was to use some grip tape on the main buttons so I had more control. The battery life is good, it lasts longer than my MX battery did so I have no complaints about that. G-Hub is required to use it but once you have everything set up the way you want, you can store the settings to the mouse and uninstall it if it bothers you that much, I came from Setpoint so G-Hub doesn't seem that bad.

So why the 1 star review after all this good ? The switches, within 2 weeks of owning this mouse I was getting double clicks on the left mouse button, it started with just one every once and awhile but then it started to happen more and more often, at first I thought (hoped) it was the grip tape I added, so I removed it, no change. I did find that I could get it to work normally if I pressed down hard and held the mouse button for a bit longer than I normally would but that just isn't something I was willing to do every time. So I came here thinking I would exchange it for a new one but they are out of stock. Between that and the fact that I really like so much about this mouse I decided to fix it myself and keep it. I bought some Kaith red micro switches and replaced the two main mouse switches with them. This worked great and I now have a perfect mouse, but I shouldn't need to fix a new product. If I was the only person who had this experience I would chalk it up to one bad product out of millions and still give it a good review but so many others have the same double click issues that this is obviously a QC issue that needs to be resolved. Logitech, if you read this, please, please fix this issue. You have an amazing product that is being ruined by a couple of $.50 switches.

To anyone else having this issue, if you want to go the same route I went just search ""G502 Lightspeed Full Teardown / Switch Replacement"" and there is a Reddit post that walks you through what to do with pics, it's really very easy if you know how to solder. If anyone has any questions just ask here and I will be happy to add any info that is needed."
Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I've been a loyal Logitech buyer since mx518, but I can't anymore. This is now the 4th Logi mouse I've had with bad switches within 2 years, and now the sensor is going bad. It has been about 1 year of use on this one. I'm not RMA'ing these anymore, I'd just rather purchase something that is reliable.

There are some baffling quality choices they've made on these. Not only in the switches that seem to have an abhorrent fail rate, but in just the quality. I realize now that I've gotten an equivalent replacement from another brand how much actual garbage is here. The feet are baffling. they are the thickness and flexibility of electric tape. I use a hard mat and they started folding over within months. The one around the sensor has a gap. since this is also recessed a bit (not the case on the new different-brand mouse) it's like it's begging to collect the most garbage possible. Which made the initial sensor issues so frustrating to figure out until it got overt. I couldn't tell if a random hair or something just got in there. It also makes an audible loose shake when you move it quickly right out of the box. That just feels and sounds bad. The switches all have a squishy actuation to them that feel imprecise.

I have large hands, so even though the size feels ok, the placement of the dpi switches are impossible to not smash mid-match at key times. mileage may vary there.

I had a lot of people recommend the 502 after the other high-end logi models I had already replaced. So the seem popular. But this was my last try with Logitech. I don't know how you charge this much for hardware like this.

Also of mention: the software, G-hub, though it looked fine, was functionally kind of a nightmare. and especially with other Logi peripherals. before replacing this, support had put forth that maybe closing the mouse's own software while running games would stop the sensor issue. that was actually the exact point where I just laughed, pulled up an amazon tab and bought a different brand. and so far, that was a fantastic decision."
Thomas Cederlof,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I'm so sick of people praising Logitech support. They are so SO bad at their customer support. Which is a shame, because usually their physical product is good but half the time there's is some small flaw that causes their products (whether it's mouse, keyboard or headset). Wouldn't be as much of a problem if it happens within the first 30 days through Amazon to get a replacement. But the minute you have to go through the Logitech Customer Support just consider yourself screwed (you ain't getting a replacement back). Their website and customer support is so backwards and convoluted it's almost like it's on purpose. It worked okay when I first bought, then as soon as I can't do an Amazon return, *POOF* it just fails to connect or turn on. Then you refer to their official FAQ, Reddit and random Google searches to troubleshoot. Nothing works. So you try to create a ticket, you tell them that you tried everything multiple times with nothing fixing it, yet Logitech Customer Support websites keep requiring you to login, then they refer you to the FAQ like 100 times, then to a AI chatbot where you have to say ""NOT HELPFUL"" to every same ""solution"" you've already read and tried 100 times. Then when you get a ""live chat agent"", they ask the SAME QUESTIONS, AGAIN, but spanned out over a 45 minute time waste. Then they say ""Give us your Name and Address, we will create a ticket number and email you. Then you get the email, with no information other then a ticket number they tell you refer but it literally doesn't exist on your account options or anything on their website. So you reply to the email and say just link me to the ticket, and their response is the LITERAL exact email that your responding too, but piled on that is them asking to refer to the FAQ and asking for your Name and address yet again as if they just didn't save that information. Do this over a few months and its like great, I've already done this 5-10 in this weird feed back loop when getting assistance can be easily done one time. Logitech SUCKS. Out of $115. These people suck so bad at customer support, so yeah if someone tells you that Logitech Support is good, they are dumb or lying. Keep that in mind."

When it comes to the Logitech Program... its annoying AF.

Update:
12/5/2019

The double-clicking has gotten really noticeable. Not bad enough it affects me in FPS games cause I am just shootings. I do notice it when using google and I double click things. Happens 1/20 or sometimes more or less. Its sad the mouse is not as good as the wired version. I have 5 of the wired versions for my desktop, laptop, traveling, work, and at my other home. The mouse otherwise is great other than sometimes it losing the profile I am on or not being detected in the GHUB which is a GHUB issue and always has been unless you use wired. I take that back cause it has even lost my speakers and my keyboard that is wired. The GHUB program is a terrible man. I wouldn't use it but for the G502 Light Speed you cant use the old software that is simple and has no issues. I have thought about switching back to the old wired G502 and gaming back to the old program, but I will wait until I get the point where I can't stand the double-clicking. Most other games from FPS I normally use a controller for RPG, sports, or racing games. GHUB is terrible. Don't even get me started about that stupid program or just google all the issues people have had with it. I once had to reformat my computer to get it uninstalled so I could reinstall it to get it to update because the update froze as it does for a lot of people and the ways to fix it were not working like normal. I would not use this mouse. The price is high but so are all really nice things and the double-clicking and software which I think is the worse part I would not buy right now."
Tim Bohrer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Mouse jumps around a lot, it is easily the best mouse I have ever had. Yet, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. If you are moving the mouse even if you aren't touching the scroll wheel it will jump around and move on its own. Kinda insane because you can't scroll through webpages, or play games that utilize the mouse wheel. The worst part is that there isn't a fix for it other than ""firmware update"" which I am up to date.

Seems simple enough to program the mouse to ignore oposite rolling unless rolling for more than 2 or 3 clicks or what ever... Seems even easier to give the custom program a sliding scale for sensitivity for the mouse, or any other mouse out there.

I spent a lot extra and have the wireless charging pad and got this mouse to go with it. Ugh, what a pain in the butt."
bahmtoll,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I would've given 0 Star if I could've.

I originally had G502 Hero (Wired) I liked it, so I ordered wireless one G502 Lightspeed with 25K HERO sensor.
When i received, I read the box since there are two different model for G502 Lightspeed.
One is old model with 16K sensor, newer model is with 25K sensor.
But on the box says 16K sensor. So checked the model number and serial number under the bottom cover of the mouse. It was shocking.

1) First, the number on the box were stickers covered original one. (I am not sure if the original one comes like that since i did not take it off. I needed to return.

2) The model number on the mouse was 810-006427 which was old model.
(Newer model number should be 910-005565)
The model number on the box has the newer model number.

3) I also checked serial number, the number on the box and the number on the bottom of the mouse did not match either.

I contacted AMAZON, and they said they were sorry and made the replacement taking 2 more days, guess what ?
The same thing happened.

And additionally, the replacement looks like it was used - checked the skid pad under the mouse.
The plastic cover was not in the correct way and skid pad was not fresh.
How can this happen with plastic sealed product ?

The Product Number and the serial number on the box were stickers. I don't know actual product was made like that. But what I know is they came with plastic covers which were sealed.

At this point, I don't know what to do. returning and getting a replacement will make the same thing happen again for sure because AMAZON will not be able to open the box before shipping to check.
even if they do, that means I am going to receive opened box.

The worst experience ever."
Vladislav,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I bought two of these for $163 each, and I just had to throw away mine. Yes, it lasted for about 4-5 years or so, but it's not enough when a mouse costs like three very good mice. I had to replace my older top-end Logitech mouse for the exact same reason. They've known about the issue, but they wouldn't start using different switches. It makes them money at the end of the day. Reviewers never mention this in video reviews either because they get paid, so you'll find out about it later. I'd recommend going for the cheaper version for $40. It's the ""G502 HERO"" wired version. It's WAY worth $40. The mouse is amazing.

I have to say this Hero sensor is the best sensor I've ever seen in a mouse. The mouse is amazing in all other aspects. The movement is precise, and I definitely started enjoying FPS games way more. You always feel in control, and aiming is just so much fun."
Peter,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","This mouse needs to be plugged in if you plan on multitasking. It works fine when a single app is open. But if you plan to stream, do any sort of recording or multitasking IT WILL DISCONNECT. Even when it is plugged in the performance is choppy while im trying to stream.

Only good thing to be said about it is it really lasts for 2-3 days of extended gaming between charges."

Along with the double click issue, I now also have the holding click not working issue, so the clicker on this sucker is apparently nearing its end. Sometimes can't drag a window or content as it stops the click press. You can know you have this issue because the mouse has a click sound both when pressed and depressed, so if it stops dragging and then you release the click, you hear the sound. What a waste. Good while it worked. No more expensive Logitech stuff for me.

Updated: Less than a year in
I finally started experiencing the dreaded double click when single clicking. It happens just enough to cause me grief at times. Definitely my last Logitech mouse as they seem very prone to this. After spending $$ on the mouse and wireless pad, this mouse ended up costing a good chunk to not even last a year. I do like the comfort with the wireless. Buyer beware.

Updated: 5 months later
While this mouse is about the same as all Logitech mice I've ever owned (more than I can recall), it ends up about the same as every one of them. It is extremely prone to gathering crude on the bottom side of the mouse. More so than any others I've owned (Razer, Steel, several other brands). It is as if they think the underside of the mouse should be pretty, with different designs and indents. My cat likes to use my mouse pad as her resting spot and dogs are flying around with plenty of hair in the breeze. I think about all of it collects under this mouse better than my air purifier. I'm constantly having to clean it since it grabs everything due to poor underside smoothness. Maybe if I used it in a sterile environment?

Otherwise, the charging, along with Logitech's charge pad, has been working great. It stays charged between 85 and 95%. I worked around the changing DPI when the mouse sleeps by setting up an offline profile on the mouse that matched my normal DPI usage. Then turned off the offline mode. It appears that when the mouse sleeps, it defaults to the offline DPI, so you get that pause of difference each time you start using the mouse.

Probably my last attempt with Logitech. I'll probably try replacing the feet and maybe just smearing some silicon across the bottom parts to see if I can reduce it's pickup of hair and stuff.

Original:
I've owned too many Logitech mice to count over the years - other G502 models, G500 and on. For many years, the G500 was my go to. I think they stopped making it because, well, you apparently just have to keep changing things so you can market something different. At any rate, my last G502 Proteus suffered the same fate of many mice today where the clicker stopped functioning correctly, which of course kind of defeats the purpose of the mouse. This G502 Lightspeed is basically the same mouse as far as I can tell. Maybe a little better tracking, although I never had issues with mice that did half what the advertised tracking is today on these.

I had switched over and tried Razor, Steel and a few other with little to no success. They were either made of cheap parts (plastic/glue that eventually smudged all over) or had similar click issue. Since no company seems capable of producing quality products in 2021, I went back to Logitech.

If you like a bigger size mouse that has weight to it, this is your mouse. After trying other mice that were smaller and 2/3 of less the weight of this mouse, I realized that long term use of a small, light mouse isn't for me. My hand would cramp and my forearm would ache. I also missed the thumb holder of all things.

There are still some flaws in the design of this mouse. I don't know what kind of thumb you should be born with to use all the buttons correctly.

I bought some Kaith red micro switches and replaced the two main mouse switches with them. This worked great and I now have a perfect mouse, but I shouldn't need to fix a new product. If I was the only person who had this experience I would chalk it up to one bad product out of millions and still give it a good review but so many others have the same double click issues that this is obviously a QC issue that needs to be resolved. Logitech, if you read this, please, please fix this issue. You have an amazing product that is being ruined by a couple of $.50 switches.

To anyone else having this issue, if you want to go the same route I went just search ""G502 Lightspeed Full Teardown / Switch Replacement"" and there is a Reddit post that walks you through what to do with pics, it's really very easy if you know how to solder. If anyone has any questions just ask here and I will be happy to add any info that is needed."
Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I've been a loyal Logitech buyer since mx518, but I can't anymore. This is now the 4th Logi mouse I've had with bad switches within 2 years, and now the sensor is going bad. It has been about 1 year of use on this one. I'm not RMA'ing these anymore, I'd just rather purchase something that is reliable.

There are some baffling quality choices they've made on these. Not only in the switches that seem to have an abhorrent fail rate, but in just the quality. I realize now that I've gotten an equivalent replacement from another brand how much actual garbage is here. The feet are baffling. they are the thickness and flexibility of electric tape. I use a hard mat and they started folding over within months. The one around the sensor has a gap. since this is also recessed a bit (not the case on the new different-brand mouse) it's like it's begging to collect the most garbage possible. Which made the initial sensor issues so frustrating to figure out until it got overt. I couldn't tell if a random hair or something just got in there. It also makes an audible loose shake when you move it quickly right out of the box. That just feels and sounds bad. The switches all have a squishy actuation to them that feel imprecise.

I have large hands, so even though the size feels ok, the placement of the dpi switches are impossible to not smash mid-match at key times. mileage may vary there.

I had a lot of people recommend the 502 after the other high-end logi models I had already replaced. So the seem popular. But this was my last try with Logitech. I don't know how you charge this much for hardware like this.

Also of mention: the software, G-hub, though it looked fine, was functionally kind of a nightmare. and especially with other Logi peripherals. before replacing this, support had put forth that maybe closing the mouse's own software while running games would stop the sensor issue. that was actually the exact point where I just laughed, pulled up an amazon tab and bought a different brand. and so far, that was a fantastic decision."
Thomas Cederlof,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I'm so sick of people praising Logitech support. They are so SO bad at their customer support. Which is a shame, because usually their physical product is good but half the time there's is some small flaw that causes their products (whether it's mouse, keyboard or headset). Wouldn't be as much of a problem if it happens within the first 30 days through Amazon to get a replacement. But the minute you have to go through the Logitech Customer Support just consider yourself screwed (you ain't getting a replacement back). Their website and customer support is so backwards and convoluted it's almost like it's on purpose. It worked okay when I first bought, then as soon as I can't do an Amazon return, *POOF* it just fails to connect or turn on. Then you refer to their official FAQ, Reddit and random Google searches to troubleshoot. Nothing works. So you try to create a ticket, you tell them that you tried everything multiple times with nothing fixing it, yet Logitech Customer Support websites keep requiring you to login, then they refer you to the FAQ like 100 times, then to a AI chatbot where you have to say ""NOT HELPFUL"" to every same ""solution"" you've already read and tried 100 times. Then when you get a ""live chat agent"", they ask the SAME QUESTIONS, AGAIN, but spanned out over a 45 minute time waste. Then they say ""Give us your Name and Address, we will create a ticket number and email you. Then you get the email, with no information other then a ticket number they tell you refer but it literally doesn't exist on your account options or anything on their website. So you reply to the email and say just link me to the ticket, and their response is the LITERAL exact email that your responding too, but piled on that is them asking to refer to the FAQ and asking for your Name and address yet again as if they just didn't save that information. Do this over a few months and its like great, I've already done this 5-10 in this weird feed back loop when getting assistance can be easily done one time. Logitech SUCKS. Out of $115. These people suck so bad at customer support, so yeah if someone tells you that Logitech Support is good, they are dumb or lying. Keep that in mind."
Mike G,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2019","As fast or faster than the wired version. I use the Logitech charging mouse pad. The only issue is I have to turn it off and on someones to fix the LEDs from not matching or loading the profile normally fixes it.

When it comes to the Logitech Program... its annoying AF.

Update:
12/5/2019

The double-clicking has gotten really noticeable. Not bad enough it affects me in FPS games cause I am just shootings. I do notice it when using google and I double click things. Happens 1/20 or sometimes more or less. Its sad the mouse is not as good as the wired version. I have 5 of the wired versions for my desktop, laptop, traveling, work, and at my other home. The mouse otherwise is great other than sometimes it losing the profile I am on or not being detected in the GHUB which is a GHUB issue and always has been unless you use wired. I take that back cause it has even lost my speakers and my keyboard that is wired. The GHUB program is a terrible man. I wouldn't use it but for the G502 Light Speed you cant use the old software that is simple and has no issues. I have thought about switching back to the old wired G502 and gaming back to the old program, but I will wait until I get the point where I can't stand the double-clicking. Most other games from FPS I normally use a controller for RPG, sports, or racing games. GHUB is terrible. Don't even get me started about that stupid program or just google all the issues people have had with it. I once had to reformat my computer to get it uninstalled so I could reinstall it to get it to update because the update froze as it does for a lot of people and the ways to fix it were not working like normal. I would not use this mouse. The price is high but so are all really nice things and the double-clicking and software which I think is the worse part I would not buy right now."
Tim Bohrer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Mouse jumps around a lot, it is easily the best mouse I have ever had. Yet, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. If you are moving the mouse even if you aren't touching the scroll wheel it will jump around and move on its own. Kinda insane because you can't scroll through webpages, or play games that utilize the mouse wheel. The worst part is that there isn't a fix for it other than ""firmware update"" which I am up to date.

Seems simple enough to program the mouse to ignore oposite rolling unless rolling for more than 2 or 3 clicks or what ever... Seems even easier to give the custom program a sliding scale for sensitivity for the mouse, or any other mouse out there.

I spent a lot extra and have the wireless charging pad and got this mouse to go with it. Ugh, what a pain in the butt."
bahmtoll,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I would've given 0 Star if I could've.

I originally had G502 Hero (Wired) I liked it, so I ordered wireless one G502 Lightspeed with 25K HERO sensor.
When i received, I read the box since there are two different model for G502 Lightspeed.
One is old model with 16K sensor, newer model is with 25K sensor.
But on the box says 16K sensor. So checked the model number and serial number under the bottom cover of the mouse. It was shocking.

1) First, the number on the box were stickers covered original one. (I am not sure if the original one comes like that since i did not take it off. I needed to return.

2) The model number on the mouse was 810-006427 which was old model.
(Newer model number should be 910-005565)
The model number on the box has the newer model number.

3) I also checked serial number, the number on the box and the number on the bottom of the mouse did not match either.

I contacted AMAZON, and they said they were sorry and made the replacement taking 2 more days, guess what ?
The same thing happened.

And additionally, the replacement looks like it was used - checked the skid pad under the mouse.
The plastic cover was not in the correct way and skid pad was not fresh.
How can this happen with plastic sealed product ?

The Product Number and the serial number on the box were stickers. I don't know actual product was made like that. But what I know is they came with plastic covers which were sealed.

At this point, I don't know what to do. returning and getting a replacement will make the same thing happen again for sure because AMAZON will not be able to open the box before shipping to check.
even if they do, that means I am going to receive opened box.

The worst experience ever."
Vladislav,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I bought two of these for $163 each, and I just had to throw away mine. Yes, it lasted for about 4-5 years or so, but it's not enough when a mouse costs like three very good mice. I had to replace my older top-end Logitech mouse for the exact same reason. They've known about the issue, but they wouldn't start using different switches. It makes them money at the end of the day. Reviewers never mention this in video reviews either because they get paid, so you'll find out about it later. I'd recommend going for the cheaper version for $40. It's the ""G502 HERO"" wired version. It's WAY worth $40. The mouse is amazing.

I have to say this Hero sensor is the best sensor I've ever seen in a mouse. The mouse is amazing in all other aspects. The movement is precise, and I definitely started enjoying FPS games way more. You always feel in control, and aiming is just so much fun."

But if you plan to stream, do any sort of recording or multitasking IT WILL DISCONNECT. Even when it is plugged in the performance is choppy while im trying to stream.

M. Chase Masters,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","Logitech's higher end mice: G903 Lightspeed and the G502 Lightspeed have a common problem: double-clicking. Over a short period of time, it can get very aggravating.

I bought both models, one for me and one for my girlfriend. In several months both acquired the double click problem from their ""Omron"" switches Logitech uses. So my mice are under warranty, right? So I put in a ticket on Logitech's site (which that alone is confusing) and days later I receive canned emails asking me to go through endless troubleshooting steps, which I did. Days later I received an email asking me to record videos with my smartphone camera of the mouse, it's serial number, and a handwritten note with the case number, provide a copy of my receipt, record another video of their ""double click"" test and upload all of this to a Google Drive folder and provide them the link to it.

I do all this. I then receive an email from their technical support telling me they need to inspect my mouse. So after all that, they want me to stick the mouse in a box and ship it to them. Of course, this is simply to try and wear you out, so you give up.

Take my word for it, if you are a gamer do not buy these mice. I'd suggest the Razer mice that come with their optical switches. They last longer than Logitech's mechanical, and they are also less prone to Logitech's double-clicking nightmares."
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","I bought this to replace my previous wired g502 mouse. The new Logitech software for managing the mouse is absolutely garbage. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen constantly, where I have to go into task manager and quit every related process, then restart the software. This happens whenever my computer disconnects from a network connection as well. Anytime I lose network connection, the Ghub software goes back to the infinite loading screen glitch. I game on my laptop a lot and I will connect to a hotspot occasionally, then disconnect when I'm done. Every time network changes happen it bricks there GHub app, forcing me to quit all processes, etc. It makes it so anytime I change network settings I have to go through a 5 minute process to get my mouse working again.

Matthew Fintonis,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I've been using Logitech mice for a long time, and I've loved every single one including the G502. It's amazing to use with the powerplay mouse pad and have a wireless mouse that never has to be recharged. However, there has been a recurring theme with these mice and that is the infamous double click issue. Before my G502, I had a G900 that I had for a couple years that never experienced this issue. I eventually had to replace that one though because the battery stopped holding a charge. I then got the G903, theoretically the same identical mouse but also supported the then new powerplay mousepad. Well, I went through THREE of them and they all started producing a double click issue after only a couple months after purchase. I thought maybe there was something wrong with that model so I ended up purchasing the G502. Well, I bought it back in March and it's only July and guess what? Double-clicking issue is showing up already. Logitech, you make great products, but this double click issue is now in so many of your mice that I can no longer recommend your brand to my friends and I can no longer trust Logitech peripherals. Even if it wasn't for the switch issue, the software you created, Logitech G Hub, is the most atrocious piece of software I have ever used. It seemingly only wants to work half the time with most of the time it just failing to launch without a complete uninstall and reinstall. Logitech, you need to step up your game with your quality assurance and your software development if you want to compete in this crowded market."

The software just doesn’t work as intended, there are many times that I had to reconfigure my mouse to make sure I could move the pointer more than 1 inch on the screen every time I woke my Pc up. It’s annoying that the software has to load before the mouse actually works as intended, but even then the settings won’t save. I’ve done the research to try and fix it.

Maybe there is something that I am missing, but the G-Hub has no tutorial, and after hours of trying to figure it out and searching the web for help, I've decided to return this item. My Razer Basilisk never had any issues, and the corresponding app was so easy my aged grandmother could figure it out."
Firefly,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Mouse is a piece of Junk. Like many others, mine started acting up after 2 days. DPI control buttons wouldn't toggle. Mouse would randomly change DPI. When I started my PC in the morning, mouse would lag, and I had to reboot to get it to stop. GHUB software is the absolute worst piece of crap software ever, especially if you plan to use a Powerplay mat. I originally had a G903 Lightspeed but wanted to switch to this for the design profile.

Especially with the Powerplay mat, if you already have a mouse paired with it, it is impossible to remove an old mouse and pair with a new mouse using GHUB. You literally have to uninstall GHUB, and install the older LGS software (better download it now before it becomes unavailable). Then use the LGS software to put the Powerplay mat back into pairing mode. You then pair the new mouse with the Powerplay mat. Once done though, your mouse will work, but you cannot customize anything on the mouse with the LGS software. You then have to uninstall it, and reinstall GHUB. It only took me 2 weeks to find this solution on the internet and it most definitely was not on the Logitech support site.

I had to go through this twice. First to install the G502, and again to reinstall my G903 which is working perfectly."
brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","To begin, I feel compelled to automatically take 2 possible stars away from this product due to the ludicrous price tag that is attached. There is no reason this mouse should cost $149, it is comparable to tons of wireless mice in lower price ranges. This bugs me to start, especially considering the wired version is $49 - pretty sure it shouldn't cost $100 to remove a cable.

That said, the wired version of this mouse is arguably my favorite productivity/gaming mouse in recent memory. The downside was that the cable was terrible (frays, fabric gets caught on everything, etc.). I decided after much time to just pull the trigger on the wireless version, hoping this would fulfill my needs for quite some time.

Safe to say it... did not.

Laughably, the mouse did not work correctly out of the box. Apparently they did not put that extra $100 toward making a quality mouse either. The DPI Shift button, with and without the new logitech software, constantly becomes 'stuck' inputting anywhere from 2 - 50 inputs each time it is clicked. I typically remap this button to something other than DPI shift and have not had this problem with either of the two wired-versions of this mouse I have had, but this problem was persistent to the point where the button was unusable.

TLDR; Absolutely do not spend $150 on this mouse. The wired version is ~$49, and there are many reasonably priced wireless mice otherwise. Most of those probably even work out of the box! (hopefully)"
Alice M. Videlock,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","Initially I thought it was due to a driver issue, I'd click and sometimes it would click twice.
So I tried uninstalling the HID mouse driver, reinstalling, restarting. Same issue.
Then I thought maybe it was the brand new computer I built, so I tried my work computer. Same issue. Tried my old computer. Same issue. Tried my parents computer. Same. Issue.
This is coming from a mouse that had a similar problem - the g703. That mouse started with issues, but somehow fixed itself. I'd still once in a while have a double click here or there, but it was so infrequent that I paid it no mind. Eventually, after 6 years of use it just hit a point where I couldn't click and drag, it'd just continuously click forever.
I deemed it dead, and decided I liked the features of the mouse too much to give up on logitech, surely I wouldn't get similar issues with a new model?

I was wrong.

Three days in the issue happened instantly. On mouse down, click. Part of the way up (before you here the click) the mouse would just start detecting clicks multiple times a second.

I know there are ways to fix it and clean it, but that's not what I'm paying for. I don't want to open the mouse to have to fix something that should just work.

I'm sorry logitech, this is just shameful, and with these issues being so longstanding I just can't go with your products ever again."

What killed the mouse for me was the dreaded Logitech double-click issue. Less than two days after the item arrived every click was detected as a double-click. It'd click once on the downstroke, and click again on the release. It wasn't dropped, and is in a clean environment. I thought it might be software related, so I removed all Logitech software, uninstalled/cleaned the drivers, and even tried in Linux and in Safe Mode, the problem was still there.

So, it's getting returned, and for $150 I'm not going to gamble on another one.

Update

Ok, so I didn't take my own advice, and I gambled on a second one. I loved this mouse while it was working, it did everything I wanted extremely well, and I figured maybe I just got a lemon. The second one arrived last week, and stopped working last night. Same issues with the left click always detecting as a double-click. You can fix it with new switches, but that involves soldering, and ordering more parts for a $150 mouse. Strongly recommend just staying away entirely, don't gamble like I did."

Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Bought this during a sale for $99. Received the mouse and checked the box for SN and model number, everything looked good. Box appeared to have the original clear plastic wrap, so it wasn't a return or anything. Opened it up, started to charge it and add the custom weights and noticed the SN and the model number were different than what was on the box. The model number that was on the mouse was 810-006427 and on the box was 910-005565. I did some research and the mouse with the 810 model number does NOT have the 25k sensor. So I reached out to Logitech directly and they told me that they couldn't find the serial number in there system and it's likely that this is not a legitimate G502. So processes a return to get it replaced. For the second mouse I had the same problem, box looked new and unopened, but the SN and model on the box was completely different that what the actual mouse had on it. I returned this one as well and ordered directly from the Logitech website. I would not suggest buying this from here (even though it's through the Logitech storefront)"
vibe,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","First of all, the mouse feels small (I wear size L gloves FWIW) compared to the Logitech MX Master 3 and the tiny buttons are placed very close to each other in places where it's very easy to accidentally press. Speaking of buttons, the two buttons directly adjacent to the left of the Left mouse button was one of my biggest frustrations with this device. You cannot remap or disable this button. The default is the DPI increase or decrease setting. When you are gaming or just casually browsing and you accidentally press this button, suddenly the mouse sensitivity is drastically changed. Even when you try to disable these buttons for 'Desktop' and for specific games, it will still adjust the DPI settings.

I really tried to like this mouse despite the bad ergonomics but those two buttons mapped to DPI settings is what made this unusable for me."

D. Lackey,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","This mouse looks wonderful, feels wonderful, and the battery life is incredible. Even with heavy use, I might have to charge it once every two weeks. I'm hit or miss regarding the software it comes with but for the most part it's a great mouse with a terrible, terrible (quite literally) game breaking flaw.

The problem is that the switches in this mouse are trash and they will die on you, probably sooner rather than later. My first one lasted maybe a month or two tops before the right click and middle click ceased functioning properly. To Logitech's credit, customer service did promptly issue a replacement, no questions asked, no additional charges applied. The second mouse lasted a little longer but again those exact same issues propped up.

I play a very Final Fantastical MMO and rely on middle mouse for Discord and right click for camera and movement, so when BOTH of these go haywire it's not only frustrating but potentially detrimental to the group I play with.

For casual use I could see this being an incredible mouse, but for gaming it falls short and falls short quickly. We recently picked the Razer Basilisk Ultimate (Wireless) instead and that's been a solid replacement. The G502 has been a disappointment and I'll probably be wary of Logitech mice from here on out."

BUT... and a BIG but. The software is terrible. Not intuitive and awful UI. Seriously, you'd think a gaming company could put some lipstick on a single window and build back some intuitive function. Nope. I bought this specifically for the on board memory for situations where I can't install or am not allowed admin access. It's a nightmare. I'm a savvy guy but this is really a marvel of convoluted UI. To make matters worse, the documentation is almost non-existent.

Mac users: I'll add that I tried to install G-hub on a Mac and it failed. Flat out failed. I tried to uninstall and reinstall... Fail. I even manually deleted the libraries. Never got it to work.

My primary use is PC and app specific on machines that I cannot modify for various reasons. I need 3 profiles to rapidly switch. The software failed my use case."
Michael Spengler,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023","I received this mouse today after reading a vast number of 1-star reviews and shrugging them off as “sour grapes” reviews. After receiving the mouse, downloading the GHUB, and using it for about 30 minutes, I put it back in the box, afraid I might break it before I could return it for a refund. For my gaming ASUS ROG STRIX laptop I use the Razer Basilisk Ultimate mouse. Comparing the two would be like comparing a 2023 Mustang GT to 1972 Ford Pinto! I am SO disappointed in the quality of this Logitech mouse. Lightweight, fragile, frail are just a few descriptive words that come to mind. AVOID AT ALL COST!"
Mongoose,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2023","Long time, and loyal Logitech user. I'm very sad to report that I wasted hours, and hours, and hours, of researching the necessary LGHUB software diagnostic steps for the G502. I persued and tried the many published lists of very detailed work-arounds and things to try,. The LGHUB won't load past the animation screen. In the end, none of the many troubleshooting steps worked. Bottom line - it's not my job to fix another developer's defective software. I wish Logitech's CEO and corporate staff all the best in recognizing and remedying LGHUB. As for me, I'm sorry I don't have hours and days to keep trying to make it work. For the millions of G502 users who made it work, you have my admiration."
Dan N,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023","This review is based solely on the fact that Logitech is falsely advertising that this mouse will charge with the POWERPLAY mat. It does not. You have to recharge this mouse with the included cord and that is the ONLY way to charge it, despite what Logitech support says --> their own documentation on the Powerplay mat even shows that only the G903 and G703 will charge when connected to the Powerplay system.

If you are purchasing this mouse to use with Powerplay, do not do it until Logitech admits their mistake and offers fixes for those of us stupid enough to believe them.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOUSE!!!"
Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022","Beware, there is a known right click issue with this model. Mine presented itself 2 months outside of the warranty. I emailed Logitech and they told me I was out of luck and suggested 3!! different times that I should buy their latest model.

Its a $2 switch, and about 15 minute repair time.

The problem with the switch is that it builds up static electricity. Literally blowing under the right click fin/face, allowing some humidity in, will discharge the static build up for the time being.

But, you'll be happy to know Logitech was very pleased to hear I was able to repair it myself. This was their top of the line model when I purchased it, and they were unable to stand behind their bad hardware/design decisions. Buy something else."
Peter Q.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022","Okay so no joke. I received this mouse sealed, but I could see through the plastic that it seemed to be stuck to the box a little bit. I open it up and my GOD. This thing is covered in what smells like Icy Hot? Tiger Balm? Like really minty, but in a medicinal way. I touched the box and now my hands have whatever this is on them after washing them multiple times. I used a paper towel to open the box and on the inside of the box, more oil. The mouse itself seemed to be clear of fingerprints or mystery oil, but one of the plastic peels was slightly off (probably from all the fumes of this minty hell) The mouse itself reeks of this now and I'm likely going to just send this one back and go with one where I don't have to wonder how this even happens.

I would expect a mouse that costs over 100 dollars to last at least 3-4 years. It was nice while it lasted, but shelling over 100 dollars for a mouse every 2 years + a week is not happening - I am very disappointment in the quality of logitech products. Will look elsewhere."

B. Shin,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","It worked well until 5 days past the return period. Now it started developing Logitech mouse's usual left click problem. I've been using the Logitech mouse for the past 20+ years and they ALWAYS had this problem. Even with this $120 mouse. But until now, all the previous Logitech mice showed this problem after about a year or two. Instead of fixing the problem, it now shows up in 2 months. Before, Logitech had a good warranty service, replacing the in-warranty mouse quickly. Now, their website logs you out as soon as you trying to submit a warranty claim. Genius! I have 2 years warranty, but they wouldn't let me file the claim for the barely 1-month-old $120 mouse. Their CEO must have been getting a good stock award for all the unclaimed warranties with this website updates. Well, never again going with Logitech for me, typing this on Logitech lightspeed wireless keyboard.
Their product is technologically advanced, but their disgusting CEO probably forced engineers to design it to be failed miserably in a few months."
Ryan H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","This is perhaps one of the worst mouse I have ever purchased in 30 years of pc gaming. I originally bought the 502 in August 2020 to replace a beloved 602 that was out of stock/discontinued? The issue with the 602 was the switch mechanism on the left mouse button failed after about 2 years. The 502 seems to suffer from the same quality issues as the rest of Logitech's current generation of gaming mice. I got 6 months out of this mouse and I'm already looking for a replacement. So what else is wrong with this mouse? Don't believe this review? Just google Logitech switch and double clicking.

The battery life is abysmal. Be prepared to plug it in every 2 weeks. Compared to the 602 with a pair of AA rechargeable that last 2-3 months.

The body is too small. Compared to the 602 this thing is narrow and light. If you have larger hands you'll likely experience pinky drag.

The ratcheting scroll wheel is chunky and cheap feeling.

What's good about it? The optical precision, very smooth cursor and that's about it."

StevenSW57,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022","This is NOT a Wireless mouse. In order for it to be wireless, you have to FREQUENTLY buy a USB connection and Inch long connector (LOGI BOLT USB RECEIVER and LOGI USB-C to A ADAPTOR) for 30.00 for the pair. If you don't have these then you have a Hard wired mice. It's the gift that keeps on costing. They make good mice, I should know I've bought two of them this year. I think I'll just buy a regular wireless mouse that doesn't seek to price gouge you with frivolous purchases. I wanted a wireless mouse. All I got was a wired mouse that you have to keep spending money on. DON""T BUY THIS MOUSE. You'll be sorry you did."
Dave L,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2021","I'm coming from a wired G502, it is as close to a perfect mouse that you can get. So I expected to love this mouse, and I do, very comfortable, lots of buttons, great battery life.

Except, the first one I bought had a double click issue with the right mouse button. About 1 in 20 times when you click the right mouse button, it would double click instead of single click. So, a lemon, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon.

The second one had a little bit of double click on the left mouse button. About 1 in 500 times, it was pretty rare, so while I was upset that a $120-$150 mouse had an issue like that at all, I could live with it. About two months in, the left click issue got much worse. Now it's about 1 in 8 clicks the left mouse button double clicks, and when I hold left click to drag something around, the mouse frequently ""releases"" the click on its own.

It's a fantastic mouse but Logitech has serious quality control issues."
Hunter Day,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2021","I have had this mouse for about a year now. I liked it enough out of the box to not return it. It is a heavy mouse which I don’t prefer but it’s overall a good mouse. After a year of use for casual gaming, I’ve began noticing significant issues with the M1 (left click) switch. It will occasionally doubly click or not register clicks. This is very frustrating when you are trying to spam through smokes in a game like valorant or buy a frenzy first round. You hold down M1 to spray and it shoots one bullet then stops, then you let off and press again and nothing. It’s very frustrating and expected more out of a 150 dollar mouse. I generally have heard good things about Logitech mice and will probably go with a G Pro wireless to give them another chance but the G502 did not stand the test of time. Also the practicality of putting buttons right next to the M1 button doesn’t exist."

I have had to have this specific mouse replaced twice now and the same issue confuses to happen.

After only a few months of moderate gaming, the mouse clicks will start to let go randomly making games that you have to hold down a mouse click near impossible to play.

I know this is a different product but it is from Logitech as well. I have had to have two different model headsets replaced because they eventually will start to randomly disconnect or get start. The most recent one was only replaced a few weeks ago and right off the bat I am getting electrical static as if there is an electrical short in the wiring.

I don’t plan on buy another Logitech device ever again."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","As many others have said, switches lasted about 6 months, then I started getting the double click issue and I was unable to drag items consistently. This is the end of life you can expect for this mouse that only varies with how often you are clicking. The short of it is that Logitech made a money saving decision to switch to a different, cheaper switch manufacturer years back and the last couple of generations of their mouse last only as long as the the left click switch lasts. They have had plenty of time to evaluate and fix the issue and they have decided it makes more business sense to save money on the switches. To be clear, this is no longer a quality brand and should be avoided. Customer service is a nightmare asking you to go through two dozen troubleshooting steps to fix the issue, then they are unresponsive when you have completed those steps and are ready to ship it back to them."
Crusty Chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","Imagine... you're using your G502, but except that annoying slight tug of the wire isn't there anymore. You are free, like a man urinating off the side of the grand canyon. You feel the wind between your legs. Free to aim where ever you'd like :)

Also the battery lasts forever in this thing (I keep all the LEDs off fyi). I'm tempted to believe this thing runs on nuclear power because I've definitely used it every day for a week or slightly longer without charging it with no issues.

UPDATE: The switches are faulty. Had the middle mouse button fail so I got a replacement, the middle mouse button failed again. Along with the right mouse button. Logitech does not honor a full warranty on replacement mice. Only the period of the warranty that applies to the original product. This is a fault product and not worth buying in my experience."
bryan newby,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019","The mouse/software constantly loses the key binds that have been set. They still display in the settings as set, they just don't work. Shutting the software down and restarting it doesn't do anything, rebooting the PC will cause it to work again (which I would think points more to a software than a mechanical issue). Add to this, the new maintenance software, G Hub, has one of the worst UI's I have ever seen. It is so complicated, convoluted, non-intuitive, and features like auto-switching profiles based on what application has active focus, are not what I want and they are not easily turned off. When you have to search for 'how do I do X' for your peripheral configuration app, there's a problem. Old software was simple, easy to use, never had to think about it. G Hub is the opposite of that. You cannot install the old software with this mouse, you're stuck with G Hub."
BradB,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","Battery life is nowhere near “40 hours” as the software states with RGB off.

Speaking of battery. When in wireless mode mouse will not auto off or sleep when pc is in sleep mode or off. So if you forget to turn the mouse off before bed congratulations you just lost all those hours of battery life.

Sometimes it immediately sets itself back to the DPI you want on system reboot. Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes for the software to catch up. Meanwhile you’re stuck at the default 400dpi or whatever it is.

Small for my hands.

It’s a return for me. Hopefully others have better luck."
Delinquent,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","The required G Hub software for configuring the mouse is dysfunctional. It's the worst piece of software I've dealt with in years. One excellent capability of this mouse is having 11 so-called programmable buttons. I've had a Logitech Performance MX mouse for a decade and it's easy to program a button using the older Logitech software. Let's say you want to have a button automatically close a window on the Mac. Any reasonable software would let you assign the command+w keystroks combo to a button and you are done. The brilliant G Hub software only lets you assign a single key, in this case either command or w but not the combo. So you cannot program a button for this simple action. That's just doesn't serve customers very well. And third party Mac software doesn't work with this mouse. Spare yourself headaches."

When I sent it in for warranty service, I thought I'd be getting my overpriced mouse back in a few days. It's now been over a month and STILL NO MOUSE. No clue how it could possibly take this long to provide me a replacement. I've emailed them multiple times, opened an additional ticket, and still have NO MOUSE.

Please, don't make the mistake I did and waste $150 on this worthless mouse. When it works, it's just fine. When it inevitably breaks from basic use, don't count on Logitech standing by their warranty. What a massive waste of money and time.

UPDATE: 1 Star!! For such an expensive mouse, I am surprised that of all issues, this is what I came across. The right-click button is either too sensitive or broken. It clicks too fast (or two times) when gently clicked. That has caused an issue for me during gameplay and photo-editing.

It feels like it's made for younger users who don't know that there's a better version out there, and it's more expensive to boot.

I'll keep it for an emergency backup mouse, but I'm going to buy another MX Master to replace my old one."
Kevin Dou,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Upgrading from the wired g502. The mouse itself is great but lgs no longer supports the lightspeed. Instead you are forced to use the buggy ghub software. The current software has connection problems that can be fixed occasionally by restarting the software or the computer, but will also frequently default the programmable buttons to their default function. I’ve programmed several buttons which I use for mmo and dps gaming, and when the software allows the mouse to function properly, it works great, just like my old wired g502. When it doesn’t, the two index buttons on the left of left click will default to dpi up and down, randomly changing my sensitivity.

This mouse is useless with the current ghub limitations. A definite do not buy until lgs supports this or until ghub is fixed."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","I saw a few others mention this but disregarded it; sadly this was a bad call. Bought the mouse to play Escape from Tarkov and it is unplayable. When tapping the right mouse button (to aim) it double-clicks about 50% of the time, causing you to aim down sights then immediately stop. This means if you suddenly need to aim because you encounter another player, it'll cause you to stutter when aiming and will delay things by a few seconds, which is ample enough time for the other player to kill you. After several frustrating deaths I had to go back to my wired G502 which works perfectly with the same game. (for those who know the game, I DID try to set ""aim"" to ""continuous"" and I still had the same problem."

The scroll wheel, when on the click setting, feels heavy and stiff and like it will break any minute. The left/right buttons don't inspire confidence either.
The worst thing though is that, when I tried to program it in G Hub, it would lock up and I'd have to force-close G Hub to get back out. I've used G Hub for a long time with a keyboard and had no problems so the problem must be with the mouse.

I currently own the G502, G502 Lightspeed, G910 keyboard, G933 headset, and Powerplay Mousepad.

I have uploaded a video, and you need to turn on the volume to hear the sound of clicking and releasing the button. The issue happens at click 5-6, 13-14, 26-27, 42-43, 50-52 (triple click), 71-72, 74-75, 77-78, 92-93.

Scott W,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2021","Another update 1.5 years in
Along with the double click issue, I now also have the holding click not working issue, so the clicker on this sucker is apparently nearing its end. Sometimes can't drag a window or content as it stops the click press. You can know you have this issue because the mouse has a click sound both when pressed and depressed, so if it stops dragging and then you release the click, you hear the sound. What a waste. Good while it worked. No more expensive Logitech stuff for me.

Updated: Less than a year in
I finally started experiencing the dreaded double click when single clicking. It happens just enough to cause me grief at times. Definitely my last Logitech mouse as they seem very prone to this. After spending $$ on the mouse and wireless pad, this mouse ended up costing a good chunk to not even last a year. I do like the comfort with the wireless. Buyer beware.

Updated: 5 months later
While this mouse is about the same as all Logitech mice I've ever owned (more than I can recall), it ends up about the same as every one of them. It is extremely prone to gathering crude on the bottom side of the mouse. More so than any others I've owned (Razer, Steel, several other brands). It is as if they think the underside of the mouse should be pretty, with different designs and indents. My cat likes to use my mouse pad as her resting spot and dogs are flying around with plenty of hair in the breeze. I think about all of it collects under this mouse better than my air purifier. I'm constantly having to clean it since it grabs everything due to poor underside smoothness. Maybe if I used it in a sterile environment?

Otherwise, the charging, along with Logitech's charge pad, has been working great. It stays charged between 85 and 95%. I worked around the changing DPI when the mouse sleeps by setting up an offline profile on the mouse that matched my normal DPI usage. Then turned off the offline mode. It appears that when the mouse sleeps, it defaults to the offline DPI, so you get that pause of difference each time you start using the mouse.

Probably my last attempt with Logitech. I'll probably try replacing the feet and maybe just smearing some silicon across the bottom parts to see if I can reduce it's pickup of hair and stuff.

Original:
I've owned too many Logitech mice to count over the years - other G502 models, G500 and on. For many years, the G500 was my go to. I think they stopped making it because, well, you apparently just have to keep changing things so you can market something different. At any rate, my last G502 Proteus suffered the same fate of many mice today where the clicker stopped functioning correctly, which of course kind of defeats the purpose of the mouse. This G502 Lightspeed is basically the same mouse as far as I can tell. Maybe a little better tracking, although I never had issues with mice that did half what the advertised tracking is today on these.

I had switched over and tried Razor, Steel and a few other with little to no success. They were either made of cheap parts (plastic/glue that eventually smudged all over) or had similar click issue. Since no company seems capable of producing quality products in 2021, I went back to Logitech.

If you like a bigger size mouse that has weight to it, this is your mouse. After trying other mice that were smaller and 2/3 of less the weight of this mouse, I realized that long term use of a small, light mouse isn't for me. My hand would cramp and my forearm would ache. I also missed the thumb holder of all things.

There are still some flaws in the design of this mouse. I don't know what kind of thumb you should be born with to use all the buttons correctly. If you palm the mouse, you need a thumb long as a finger to easily reach the front thumb buttons. If you claw grip, you need to bend your thumb backwards since you're over shooting the back buttons. You get used to shifting your hand around on it, although it makes for awkward motion and unsteady handling of the mouse when you're trying to be precise. The other buttons are about what you'd expect - feel the same as any other Logitech mouse I've owned.

The mouse wheel is a mixed bag. I like the grip they used on it as other mice often have some texture that doesn't feel that good for the finger. You can switch from free spin to the notched spin where you get tactical feel as you scroll. The free spin is nice, although it's a little too free. I thought I remembered prior versions not being as loose. In any software where you could go scroll happy, the free spin may spin when you don't expect it to or you can accidentally spin a bit as you reposition your fingers for that dang thumb button. I've ended up keep the tactical feel spin set, which is ok.

Given it's a wireless mouse, I opted for the PowerPlay wireless pad to go with it. The downside, if you like a really heavy mouse, is that in order to work with PowerPlay, you have to take the weights out for the charging battery. That seems like yet another big oversight. I personally don't need the weights in it, so it didn't bother me one way or the other.

Without PowerPlay and the lights turned off, I was getting around 60 to 80 hours of charge. Kind of an odd range, although I'm guessing it just depended on how long it sat there in sleep mode when I wasn't using it. With the LEDs turned on, that dropped down closer to 30 to 40 hours. That's still pretty good. I'm not sure why you have lights on a mouse to begin with because, well, your hand is generally on it and you can't see those lights. I guess if you want fancy lights when you're not at your desk, it works ok.

With PowerPlay, the mouse stays charged and I seem to stay somewhere between 80 and 90% charge almost always. It appears to drain down and then charge up a bit to not wear out the battery. The two devices together are exactly what I was hoping for - a wireless mouse that didn't have a cord dragging around and a charger that didn't require me to remember to charge up every time I turned around. I'd highly recommend the pad to go with this.

One fault I've had with most Logitech and other brands is the textured grips and especially the multiple designs on the bottom of the mice. All those indentations are dirt magnets. Sure, they look nice. Maybe they add to the handling of the mouse in some small degree. Maybe it looks nicer than a smooth, plain surface. I'd gladly trade whatever advantages for a completely smooth, easy to clean mouse though. My cat thinks my mouse pad is a bed and the mouse itself a pillow, so I constantly have hair and just whatever body oils come off my hands onto the mouse over time. Cleaning is such a pain and when any hair or residue gets on the under side of the mouse, you'll notice it tracking oddly. I'm not a slob by any means - I'd have issues here regardless of wild vermin roaming the house.

Lastly is the software. Everything you have anymore wants to install some crap in your system tray. And from what I can tell, that software is what reminds your mouse what DPI you have it set to. So while the software works ok and I've not crashed or seen any issues out of it, the one thing that I have noticed is that the mouse goes to sleep after a few minutes and soon as you start moving it instantly wakes up. There is a bit of lag between when the mouse wakes and the software sees it back alive. So the mouse is working instantly, although the DPI of the mouse is the factory default and not the custom setting. So there's this short bit of time where your DPI isn't what you think it is. Once the software realizes the mouse is awake, it tells it to change and things are good once again. Just annoying that they don't appear to save the settings on the mouse itself. Setup is a bit confusing at times with all the options, so I could have missed it.

Overall, the mouse works just like I expected. I was a little disappointed that this was almost a clone to the mouse I owned 5 or 6 years, although I like that mouse a lot, so that's ok. I'm pretty sure the wheel may be a little bit of downgrade and the sound of the clicks is a bit loud compared to some. It is very comfortable though and it felt like coming home after a couple days use. Being wireless, I'm about as happy as I could probably be, so I'd recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a wireless, heavier side, large mouse."
Mike,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","I'm trying really hard to like this mouse, I really am. I like its ergonomics, its features, and even the programmable macro buttons.

This is now the second time I've re-written this review because I was trying to be fair, but the connectivity for the mouse is just so bad, that I can't in good faith recommend it to anyone. Intermittently, the mouse will lose connection and try to 'interpolate' where the cursor should be based on the last direction it was moving. This results in very choppy movement even on low report rate. This has been happening on multiple computers with different Operating Systems (Windows 10, 11, Linux.) I tried numerous solutions around the internet, Such as:

*Cleaning the sensor
*Trying different mouse pads and surfaces
*Reinstalling Logitech's driver software
*Uninstalling the Logitech Drivers and using the onboard memory manager program instead
*Lowering the report rate down to 125Hz
*Used an extension cable to bring the receiver closer to the mouse, to a point it doesn't make sense to be wireless anymore.

I've even forgone the wireless aspect and connected it physically via USB Micro (Yes, this mouse which costs a hundred dollars in 2024, still uses USB Micro instead of C.) And the way Logitech engineers made this mouse, its annoying to try and connect physically. Sure, you may have a couple USB Micro cables still laying around, but do you have one that's thin enough? Because the female connection for USB Micro is so recessed into a narrow inset, most cables you have are probably too wide to fit in the inset. Sure, you can use the included cable but in my case it stopped working after 2 months of use. No clue why it had to be engineered this way, because I've used both an MX Master 2, and 3 and never had this design flaw.

None of these attempted solutions alleviated the fact my mouse has intermittent connection issues. I had a Logitech G604 wireless mouse and that too had the same problem: Intermittent choppy movement. I'm not sure whats going on at Logitech, but reading around online on forums, I'm not the only person having such an issue. It feels like the quality is going down, since this is the second mouse I've bought from Logi that costs over a hundred dollars, that ended up being unusable. And at this stage, its looking like I'm not going to be a returning customer.

Stay away like its the plague."
BC,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","TLDR: This is a great mouse that is ruined by bad switches

I have been waiting for the wireless version of this mouse for years, since the original came out. I was a bit put off by the price but when my MX Revolution finally broke beyond my ability to repair it, I decided to buy this.

At first I was a bit let down, I wasn't really used to a light mouse and I mistook that as a sign of poor quality. It took a couple days for me to really start to enjoy using it and after that I was hooked. It has the perfect shape for my hand, the button arrangement is easy for me to use and the lack of weight makes it very easy to move quickly or lift up to reposition without straining to keep a grip on it. The only thing I changed early on was to use some grip tape on the main buttons so I had more control. The battery life is good, it lasts longer than my MX battery did so I have no complaints about that. G-Hub is required to use it but once you have everything set up the way you want, you can store the settings to the mouse and uninstall it if it bothers you that much, I came from Setpoint so G-Hub doesn't seem that bad.

So why the 1 star review after all this good ? The switches, within 2 weeks of owning this mouse I was getting double clicks on the left mouse button, it started with just one every once and awhile but then it started to happen more and more often, at first I thought (hoped) it was the grip tape I added, so I removed it, no change. I did find that I could get it to work normally if I pressed down hard and held the mouse button for a bit longer than I normally would but that just isn't something I was willing to do every time. So I came here thinking I would exchange it for a new one but they are out of stock. Between that and the fact that I really like so much about this mouse I decided to fix it myself and keep it. I bought some Kaith red micro switches and replaced the two main mouse switches with them. This worked great and I now have a perfect mouse, but I shouldn't need to fix a new product. If I was the only person who had this experience I would chalk it up to one bad product out of millions and still give it a good review but so many others have the same double click issues that this is obviously a QC issue that needs to be resolved. Logitech, if you read this, please, please fix this issue. You have an amazing product that is being ruined by a couple of $.50 switches.

To anyone else having this issue, if you want to go the same route I went just search ""G502 Lightspeed Full Teardown / Switch Replacement"" and there is a Reddit post that walks you through what to do with pics, it's really very easy if you know how to solder. If anyone has any questions just ask here and I will be happy to add any info that is needed."
Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2023","I've been a loyal Logitech buyer since mx518, but I can't anymore. This is now the 4th Logi mouse I've had with bad switches within 2 years, and now the sensor is going bad. It has been about 1 year of use on this one. I'm not RMA'ing these anymore, I'd just rather purchase something that is reliable.

There are some baffling quality choices they've made on these. Not only in the switches that seem to have an abhorrent fail rate, but in just the quality. I realize now that I've gotten an equivalent replacement from another brand how much actual garbage is here. The feet are baffling. they are the thickness and flexibility of electric tape. I use a hard mat and they started folding over within months. The one around the sensor has a gap. since this is also recessed a bit (not the case on the new different-brand mouse) it's like it's begging to collect the most garbage possible. Which made the initial sensor issues so frustrating to figure out until it got overt. I couldn't tell if a random hair or something just got in there. It also makes an audible loose shake when you move it quickly right out of the box. That just feels and sounds bad. The switches all have a squishy actuation to them that feel imprecise.

I have large hands, so even though the size feels ok, the placement of the dpi switches are impossible to not smash mid-match at key times. mileage may vary there.

I had a lot of people recommend the 502 after the other high-end logi models I had already replaced. So the seem popular. But this was my last try with Logitech. I don't know how you charge this much for hardware like this.

Also of mention: the software, G-hub, though it looked fine, was functionally kind of a nightmare. and especially with other Logi peripherals. before replacing this, support had put forth that maybe closing the mouse's own software while running games would stop the sensor issue. that was actually the exact point where I just laughed, pulled up an amazon tab and bought a different brand. and so far, that was a fantastic decision."
Thomas Cederlof,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021","I'm so sick of people praising Logitech support. They are so SO bad at their customer support. Which is a shame, because usually their physical product is good but half the time there's is some small flaw that causes their products (whether it's mouse, keyboard or headset). Wouldn't be as much of a problem if it happens within the first 30 days through Amazon to get a replacement. But the minute you have to go through the Logitech Customer Support just consider yourself screwed (you ain't getting a replacement back). Their website and customer support is so backwards and convoluted it's almost like it's on purpose. It worked okay when I first bought, then as soon as I can't do an Amazon return, *POOF* it just fails to connect or turn on. Then you refer to their official FAQ, Reddit and random Google searches to troubleshoot. Nothing works. So you try to create a ticket, you tell them that you tried everything multiple times with nothing fixing it, yet Logitech Customer Support websites keep requiring you to login, then they refer you to the FAQ like 100 times, then to a AI chatbot where you have to say ""NOT HELPFUL"" to every same ""solution"" you've already read and tried 100 times. Then when you get a ""live chat agent"", they ask the SAME QUESTIONS, AGAIN, but spanned out over a 45 minute time waste. Then they say ""Give us your Name and Address, we will create a ticket number and email you. Then you get the email, with no information other then a ticket number they tell you refer but it literally doesn't exist on your account options or anything on their website. So you reply to the email and say just link me to the ticket, and their response is the LITERAL exact email that your responding too, but piled on that is them asking to refer to the FAQ and asking for your Name and address yet again as if they just didn't save that information. Do this over a few months and its like great, I've already done this 5-10 in this weird feed back loop when getting assistance can be easily done one time. Logitech SUCKS. Out of $115.

When it comes to the Logitech Program... its annoying AF.

Update:
12/5/2019

The double-clicking has gotten really noticeable. Not bad enough it affects me in FPS games cause I am just shootings. I do notice it when using google and I double click things. Happens 1/20 or sometimes more or less. Its sad the mouse is not as good as the wired version. I have 5 of the wired versions for my desktop, laptop, traveling, work, and at my other home. The mouse otherwise is great other than sometimes it losing the profile I am on or not being detected in the GHUB which is a GHUB issue and always has been unless you use wired. I take that back cause it has even lost my speakers and my keyboard that is wired. The GHUB program is a terrible man. I wouldn't use it but for the G502 Light Speed you cant use the old software that is simple and has no issues. I have thought about switching back to the old wired G502 and gaming back to the old program, but I will wait until I get the point where I can't stand the double-clicking. Most other games from FPS I normally use a controller for RPG, sports, or racing games. GHUB is terrible. Don't even get me started about that stupid program or just google all the issues people have had with it. I once had to reformat my computer to get it uninstalled so I could reinstall it to get it to update because the update froze as it does for a lot of people and the ways to fix it were not working like normal. I would not use this mouse. The price is high but so are all really nice things and the double-clicking and software which I think is the worse part I would not buy right now."
Tim Bohrer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023","Mouse jumps around a lot, it is easily the best mouse I have ever had. Yet, the scroll wheel has a mind of its own. If you are moving the mouse even if you aren't touching the scroll wheel it will jump around and move on its own. Kinda insane because you can't scroll through webpages, or play games that utilize the mouse wheel. The worst part is that there isn't a fix for it other than ""firmware update"" which I am up to date.

Seems simple enough to program the mouse to ignore oposite rolling unless rolling for more than 2 or 3 clicks or what ever... Seems even easier to give the custom program a sliding scale for sensitivity for the mouse, or any other mouse out there.

bahmtoll,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I would've given 0 Star if I could've.

I originally had G502 Hero (Wired) I liked it, so I ordered wireless one G502 Lightspeed with 25K HERO sensor.
When i received, I read the box since there are two different model for G502 Lightspeed.
One is old model with 16K sensor, newer model is with 25K sensor.
But on the box says 16K sensor. So checked the model number and serial number under the bottom cover of the mouse. It was shocking.

1) First, the number on the box were stickers covered original one. (I am not sure if the original one comes like that since i did not take it off. I needed to return.

2) The model number on the mouse was 810-006427 which was old model.
(Newer model number should be 910-005565)
The model number on the box has the newer model number.

3) I also checked serial number, the number on the box and the number on the bottom of the mouse did not match either.

I contacted AMAZON, and they said they were sorry and made the replacement taking 2 more days, guess what ?
The same thing happened.

And additionally, the replacement looks like it was used - checked the skid pad under the mouse.
The plastic cover was not in the correct way and skid pad was not fresh.
How can this happen with plastic sealed product ?

The Product Number and the serial number on the box were stickers. I don't know actual product was made like that. But what I know is they came with plastic covers which were sealed.

At this point, I don't know what to do. returning and getting a replacement will make the same thing happen again for sure because AMAZON will not be able to open the box before shipping to check.
even if they do, that means I am going to receive opened box.

The worst experience ever."
Vladislav,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","I bought two of these for $163 each, and I just had to throw away mine. Yes, it lasted for about 4-5 years or so, but it's not enough when a mouse costs like three very good mice. I had to replace my older top-end Logitech mouse for the exact same reason. They've known about the issue, but they wouldn't start using different switches. It makes them money at the end of the day. Reviewers never mention this in video reviews either because they get paid, so you'll find out about it later. I'd recommend going for the cheaper version for $40. It's the ""G502 HERO"" wired version. It's WAY worth $40. The mouse is amazing.

I have to say this Hero sensor is the best sensor I've ever seen in a mouse. The mouse is amazing in all other aspects. The movement is precise, and I definitely started enjoying FPS games way more. You always feel in control, and aiming is just so much fun."

M. Chase Masters,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","Logitech's higher end mice: G903 Lightspeed and the G502 Lightspeed have a common problem: double-clicking. Over a short period of time, it can get very aggravating.

I bought both models, one for me and one for my girlfriend. In several months both acquired the double click problem from their ""Omron"" switches Logitech uses. So my mice are under warranty, right? So I put in a ticket on Logitech's site (which that alone is confusing) and days later I receive canned emails asking me to go through endless troubleshooting steps, which I did. Days later I received an email asking me to record videos with my smartphone camera of the mouse, it's serial number, and a handwritten note with the case number, provide a copy of my receipt, record another video of their ""double click"" test and upload all of this to a Google Drive folder and provide them the link to it.

I do all this. I then receive an email from their technical support telling me they need to inspect my mouse. So after all that, they want me to stick the mouse in a box and ship it to them. Of course, this is simply to try and wear you out, so you give up.

Take my word for it, if you are a gamer do not buy these mice. I'd suggest the Razer mice that come with their optical switches. They last longer than Logitech's mechanical, and they are also less prone to Logitech's double-clicking nightmares."
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023","I bought this to replace my previous wired g502 mouse. The new Logitech software for managing the mouse is absolutely garbage. It gets stuck on an infinite loading screen constantly, where I have to go into task manager and quit every related process, then restart the software. This happens whenever my computer disconnects from a network connection as well. Anytime I lose network connection, the Ghub software goes back to the infinite loading screen glitch. I game on my laptop a lot and I will connect to a hotspot occasionally, then disconnect when I'm done. Every time network changes happen it bricks there GHub app, forcing me to quit all processes, etc. It makes it so anytime I change network settings I have to go through a 5 minute process to get my mouse working again. And this seems to be a known issue, with several forums throughout reddit, Logitech website, etc, yet the do nothing to resolve it. I can't recommend this mouse to anyone with this problems."
Matthew Fintonis,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020","I've been using Logitech mice for a long time, and I've loved every single one including the G502. It's amazing to use with the powerplay mouse pad and have a wireless mouse that never has to be recharged. However, there has been a recurring theme with these mice and that is the infamous double click issue. Before my G502, I had a G900 that I had for a couple years that never experienced this issue. I eventually had to replace that one though because the battery stopped holding a charge. I then got the G903, theoretically the same identical mouse but also supported the then new powerplay mousepad. Well, I went through THREE of them and they all started producing a double click issue after only a couple months after purchase. I thought maybe there was something wrong with that model so I ended up purchasing the G502. Well, I bought it back in March and it's only July and guess what? Double-clicking issue is showing up already. Logitech, you make great products, but this double click issue is now in so many of your mice that I can no longer recommend your brand to my friends and I can no longer trust Logitech peripherals. Even if it wasn't for the switch issue, the software you created, Logitech G Hub, is the most atrocious piece of software I have ever used. It seemingly only wants to work half the time with most of the time it just failing to launch without a complete uninstall and reinstall. Logitech, you need to step up your game with your quality assurance and your software development if you want to compete in this crowded market."
melissa lee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021","when i got the sealed box i was excited to open it. at first glance i immediately noticed particles in the box youd expect to see in a used open box product or something you leave open for a couple nights to allow to collect those particles. idk what conditions the logitech packaging warehouse are in, so i kept going with a positive mindset. i then noticed a SCUFF on the side of the mouse that one might overlook under different lighting conditions or can easily be overlooked in general, not bad at all if i had done it myself, but i hadnt even touched the mouse at that point, i tried to recreate the scuff and the closest i could get was using my fingernail and pressing in extremely hard, so whoever made the scuff had to drop it or something drastic to even get that as a permanent scuff. i kept going now extremely disappointed and pissed, i found tiny things that look like hairs, but i wasnt convinced until i reached the included metal weights...fingerprints on them. not mine, i still havent touched the weights, these prints again could be overlooked under different lighting conditions, my window just so happened to be the perfect light factor to show them. i can see how someone trying to repackage it would think they did a great job, but you just cant deny the prints. dissatisfied with my NEW purchase showing multiple signs of being used; if i wanted it used i wouldve saved the money and bought it used. just go to best buy or some brick and mortar store to pick yours up."

Chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2023","Im a huge Logitech fan and have been for most of my life.. but I paid $100 to add a peripheral that made my life harder than before. I understand that gaming mice are supposed to have extra features, and with that comes more complexity. The software just doesn’t work as intended, there are many times that I had to reconfigure my mouse to make sure I could move the pointer more than 1 inch on the screen every time I woke my Pc up. It’s annoying that the software has to load before the mouse actually works as intended, but even then the settings won’t save. I’ve done the research to try and fix it. But I shouldn’t have to *think* and *work* to get my mouse to do what it’s supposed to do. Save your time and money like I wish I did."
Jacob Smith,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","The mouse itself seems to be a great product, but the accompanying app, Logitech G-Hub, which you use to customize the mouse itself and the button layout, is an absolute nightmare. It is confusing, frustrating, and is not user friendly. It automatically switches profiles without your consent, which is annoying if you want to have a personalized profile while playing a game. Maybe there is something that I am missing, but the G-Hub has no tutorial, and after hours of trying to figure it out and searching the web for help, I've decided to return this item. My Razer Basilisk never had any issues, and the corresponding app was so easy my aged grandmother could figure it out."
Firefly,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2021","Mouse is a piece of Junk. Like many others, mine started acting up after 2 days. DPI control buttons wouldn't toggle. Mouse would randomly change DPI. When I started my PC in the morning, mouse would lag, and I had to reboot to get it to stop. GHUB software is the absolute worst piece of crap software ever, especially if you plan to use a Powerplay mat. I originally had a G903 Lightspeed but wanted to switch to this for the design profile.

Especially with the Powerplay mat, if you already have a mouse paired with it, it is impossible to remove an old mouse and pair with a new mouse using GHUB. You literally have to uninstall GHUB, and install the older LGS software (better download it now before it becomes unavailable). Then use the LGS software to put the Powerplay mat back into pairing mode. You then pair the new mouse with the Powerplay mat. Once done though, your mouse will work, but you cannot customize anything on the mouse with the LGS software. You then have to uninstall it, and reinstall GHUB. It only took me 2 weeks to find this solution on the internet and it most definitely was not on the Logitech support site.

I had to go through this twice. First to install the G502, and again to reinstall my G903 which is working perfectly."
brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","To begin, I feel compelled to automatically take 2 possible stars away from this product due to the ludicrous price tag that is attached. There is no reason this mouse should cost $149, it is comparable to tons of wireless mice in lower price ranges. This bugs me to start, especially considering the wired version is $49 - pretty sure it shouldn't cost $100 to remove a cable.

That said, the wired version of this mouse is arguably my favorite productivity/gaming mouse in recent memory. The downside was that the cable was terrible (frays, fabric gets caught on everything, etc.). I decided after much time to just pull the trigger on the wireless version, hoping this would fulfill my needs for quite some time.

Safe to say it... did not.

Laughably, the mouse did not work correctly out of the box. Apparently they did not put that extra $100 toward making a quality mouse either. The DPI Shift button, with and without the new logitech software, constantly becomes 'stuck' inputting anywhere from 2 - 50 inputs each time it is clicked. I typically remap this button to something other than DPI shift and have not had this problem with either of the two wired-versions of this mouse I have had, but this problem was persistent to the point where the button was unusable.

TLDR; Absolutely do not spend $150 on this mouse. The wired version is ~$49, and there are many reasonably priced wireless mice otherwise. Most of those probably even work out of the box! (hopefully)"
Alice M. Videlock,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","Initially I thought it was due to a driver issue, I'd click and sometimes it would click twice.
So I tried uninstalling the HID mouse driver, reinstalling, restarting. Same issue.
Then I thought maybe it was the brand new computer I built, so I tried my work computer. Same issue. Tried my old computer. Same issue. Tried my parents computer. Same. Issue.
This is coming from a mouse that had a similar problem - the g703. That mouse started with issues, but somehow fixed itself. I'd still once in a while have a double click here or there, but it was so infrequent that I paid it no mind. Eventually, after 6 years of use it just hit a point where I couldn't click and drag, it'd just continuously click forever.
I deemed it dead, and decided I liked the features of the mouse too much to give up on logitech, surely I wouldn't get similar issues with a new model?

I was wrong.

Three days in the issue happened instantly. On mouse down, click. Part of the way up (before you here the click) the mouse would just start detecting clicks multiple times a second.

I know there are ways to fix it and clean it, but that's not what I'm paying for. I don't want to open the mouse to have to fix something that should just work.

I'm sorry logitech, this is just shameful, and with these issues being so longstanding I just can't go with your products ever again."

thunder2132,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2019","If this mouse works, it's pretty fantastic. I like the layout, it's quick as heck, fairly lightweight for a wireless mouse, and the software, though not what I prefer, works fine for me.

What killed the mouse for me was the dreaded Logitech double-click issue. Less than two days after the item arrived every click was detected as a double-click. It'd click once on the downstroke, and click again on the release. It wasn't dropped, and is in a clean environment. I thought it might be software related, so I removed all Logitech software, uninstalled/cleaned the drivers, and even tried in Linux and in Safe Mode, the problem was still there.

So, it's getting returned, and for $150 I'm not going to gamble on another one.

Update

Ok, so I didn't take my own advice, and I gambled on a second one. I loved this mouse while it was working, it did everything I wanted extremely well, and I figured maybe I just got a lemon. The second one arrived last week, and stopped working last night. Same issues with the left click always detecting as a double-click. You can fix it with new switches, but that involves soldering, and ordering more parts for a $150 mouse. Strongly recommend just staying away entirely, don't gamble like I did."

Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2021","Bought this during a sale for $99. Received the mouse and checked the box for SN and model number, everything looked good. Box appeared to have the original clear plastic wrap, so it wasn't a return or anything. Opened it up, started to charge it and add the custom weights and noticed the SN and the model number were different than what was on the box. The model number that was on the mouse was 810-006427 and on the box was 910-005565. I did some research and the mouse with the 810 model number does NOT have the 25k sensor. So I reached out to Logitech directly and they told me that they couldn't find the serial number in there system and it's likely that this is not a legitimate G502. So processes a return to get it replaced. For the second mouse I had the same problem, box looked new and unopened, but the SN and model on the box was completely different that what the actual mouse had on it. I returned this one as well and ordered directly from the Logitech website. I would not suggest buying this from here (even though it's through the Logitech storefront)"
vibe,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2022","First of all, the mouse feels small (I wear size L gloves FWIW) compared to the Logitech MX Master 3 and the tiny buttons are placed very close to each other in places where it's very easy to accidentally press. Speaking of buttons, the two buttons directly adjacent to the left of the Left mouse button was one of my biggest frustrations with this device. You cannot remap or disable this button. The default is the DPI increase or decrease setting. When you are gaming or just casually browsing and you accidentally press this button, suddenly the mouse sensitivity is drastically changed. Even when you try to disable these buttons for 'Desktop' and for specific games, it will still adjust the DPI settings.

I really tried to like this mouse despite the bad ergonomics but those two buttons mapped to DPI settings is what made this unusable for me."

Why is it either rock hard and hurts your finger or so loose you will be scrolling all over the place accidentally? Rough on the finger to the point that it hurts. If you bind the middle click to anything it will not be a good time for your finger.

Also why does this mouse not have a physical LED on and off switch? When your computer is on you can disable the annoying lights, then when your PC is off it resets back to its LGB RAINBOW VERY BRIGHT MODE. I wonder why the batteries drain so fast?....

Also no notification if you have the software and drivers that the batteries are low, it just dies. Bad mouse

The large dpi adjustment buttons next to your index finger are also pointless and get in the way. Why would i need to adjust dpi on the fly. Makes no sense. The scroll wheel feels kinda chunky.

D. Lackey,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","This mouse looks wonderful, feels wonderful, and the battery life is incredible. Even with heavy use, I might have to charge it once every two weeks. I'm hit or miss regarding the software it comes with but for the most part it's a great mouse with a terrible, terrible (quite literally) game breaking flaw.

The problem is that the switches in this mouse are trash and they will die on you, probably sooner rather than later. My first one lasted maybe a month or two tops before the right click and middle click ceased functioning properly. To Logitech's credit, customer service did promptly issue a replacement, no questions asked, no additional charges applied. The second mouse lasted a little longer but again those exact same issues propped up.

I play a very Final Fantastical MMO and rely on middle mouse for Discord and right click for camera and movement, so when BOTH of these go haywire it's not only frustrating but potentially detrimental to the group I play with.

For casual use I could see this being an incredible mouse, but for gaming it falls short and falls short quickly. We recently picked the Razer Basilisk Ultimate (Wireless) instead and that's been a solid replacement. The G502 has been a disappointment and I'll probably be wary of Logitech mice from here on out."

Nope. I bought this specifically for the on board memory for situations where I can't install or am not allowed admin access. It's a nightmare. I'm a savvy guy but this is really a marvel of convoluted UI. To make matters worse, the documentation is almost non-existent.

Mac users: I'll add that I tried to install G-hub on a Mac and it failed. Flat out failed. I tried to uninstall and reinstall... Fail. I even manually deleted the libraries. Never got it to work.

Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2022","Beware, there is a known right click issue with this model. Mine presented itself 2 months outside of the warranty. I emailed Logitech and they told me I was out of luck and suggested 3!! different times that I should buy their latest model.

Its a $2 switch, and about 15 minute repair time.

The problem with the switch is that it builds up static electricity. Literally blowing under the right click fin/face, allowing some humidity in, will discharge the static build up for the time being.

But, you'll be happy to know Logitech was very pleased to hear I was able to repair it myself. This was their top of the line model when I purchased it, and they were unable to stand behind their bad hardware/design decisions. Buy something else."

Ryan H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021","This is perhaps one of the worst mouse I have ever purchased in 30 years of pc gaming. I originally bought the 502 in August 2020 to replace a beloved 602 that was out of stock/discontinued? The issue with the 602 was the switch mechanism on the left mouse button failed after about 2 years. The 502 seems to suffer from the same quality issues as the rest of Logitech's current generation of gaming mice. I got 6 months out of this mouse and I'm already looking for a replacement. So what else is wrong with this mouse? Don't believe this review? Just google Logitech switch and double clicking.

The battery life is abysmal. Be prepared to plug it in every 2 weeks. Compared to the 602 with a pair of AA rechargeable that last 2-3 months.

The body is too small. Compared to the 602 this thing is narrow and light. If you have larger hands you'll likely experience pinky drag.

Except, the first one I bought had a double click issue with the right mouse button. About 1 in 20 times when you click the right mouse button, it would double click instead of single click. So, a lemon, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon.

The second one had a little bit of double click on the left mouse button. About 1 in 500 times, it was pretty rare, so while I was upset that a $120-$150 mouse had an issue like that at all, I could live with it. About two months in, the left click issue got much worse. Now it's about 1 in 8 clicks the left mouse button double clicks, and when I hold left click to drag something around, the mouse frequently ""releases"" the click on its own.

It is a heavy mouse which I don’t prefer but it’s overall a good mouse. After a year of use for casual gaming, I’ve began noticing significant issues with the M1 (left click) switch. It will occasionally doubly click or not register clicks. This is very frustrating when you are trying to spam through smokes in a game like valorant or buy a frenzy first round. You hold down M1 to spray and it shoots one bullet then stops, then you let off and press again and nothing. It’s very frustrating and expected more out of a 150 dollar mouse.

After only a few months of moderate gaming, the mouse clicks will start to let go randomly making games that you have to hold down a mouse click near impossible to play.

I know this is a different product but it is from Logitech as well. I have had to have two different model headsets replaced because they eventually will start to randomly disconnect or get start. The most recent one was only replaced a few weeks ago and right off the bat I am getting electrical static as if there is an electrical short in the wiring.

I don’t plan on buy another Logitech device ever again."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021","As many others have said, switches lasted about 6 months, then I started getting the double click issue and I was unable to drag items consistently. This is the end of life you can expect for this mouse that only varies with how often you are clicking. The short of it is that Logitech made a money saving decision to switch to a different, cheaper switch manufacturer years back and the last couple of generations of their mouse last only as long as the the left click switch lasts. They have had plenty of time to evaluate and fix the issue and they have decided it makes more business sense to save money on the switches. To be clear, this is no longer a quality brand and should be avoided. Customer service is a nightmare asking you to go through two dozen troubleshooting steps to fix the issue, then they are unresponsive when you have completed those steps and are ready to ship it back to them."
Crusty Chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021","Imagine... you're using your G502, but except that annoying slight tug of the wire isn't there anymore. You are free, like a man urinating off the side of the grand canyon. You feel the wind between your legs. Free to aim where ever you'd like :)

Also the battery lasts forever in this thing (I keep all the LEDs off fyi). I'm tempted to believe this thing runs on nuclear power because I've definitely used it every day for a week or slightly longer without charging it with no issues.

UPDATE: The switches are faulty. Had the middle mouse button fail so I got a replacement, the middle mouse button failed again. Along with the right mouse button. Logitech does not honor a full warranty on replacement mice. Only the period of the warranty that applies to the original product. This is a fault product and not worth buying in my experience."
bryan newby,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2019","The mouse/software constantly loses the key binds that have been set. They still display in the settings as set, they just don't work. Shutting the software down and restarting it doesn't do anything, rebooting the PC will cause it to work again (which I would think points more to a software than a mechanical issue). Add to this, the new maintenance software, G Hub, has one of the worst UI's I have ever seen. It is so complicated, convoluted, non-intuitive, and features like auto-switching profiles based on what application has active focus, are not what I want and they are not easily turned off. When you have to search for 'how do I do X' for your peripheral configuration app, there's a problem. Old software was simple, easy to use, never had to think about it. G Hub is the opposite of that. You cannot install the old software with this mouse, you're stuck with G Hub."
BradB,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","Battery life is nowhere near “40 hours” as the software states with RGB off.

Speaking of battery. When in wireless mode mouse will not auto off or sleep when pc is in sleep mode or off. So if you forget to turn the mouse off before bed congratulations you just lost all those hours of battery life.

Sometimes it immediately sets itself back to the DPI you want on system reboot. Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes for the software to catch up. Meanwhile you’re stuck at the default 400dpi or whatever it is.

Small for my hands.

It’s a return for me. Hopefully others have better luck."
Delinquent,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","The required G Hub software for configuring the mouse is dysfunctional. It's the worst piece of software I've dealt with in years. One excellent capability of this mouse is having 11 so-called programmable buttons. I've had a Logitech Performance MX mouse for a decade and it's easy to program a button using the older Logitech software. Let's say you want to have a button automatically close a window on the Mac. Any reasonable software would let you assign the command+w keystroks combo to a button and you are done. The brilliant G Hub software only lets you assign a single key, in this case either command or w but not the combo. So you cannot program a button for this simple action. That's just doesn't serve customers very well. And third party Mac software doesn't work with this mouse. Spare yourself headaches."
Joe,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","My first Amazon review after buying hundreds of items. This pissed me off. Not buying tech anymore from Amazon.

Purchased a g502 Lightspeed, the unit would not charge after trying 3 different computers and several charging ports.

Received my replacement unit; device was DISGUSTING, scratches everywhere, box was beaten up, MISSING CRITICAL PARTS LIKE THE CHARGING CABLE!!!

I paid for a NEW UNIT, NOT a USED one. FRAUD!!!

No longer purchasing tech from Amazon."
T. Davis,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023","The mouse developed a double clicking issue when I single click the left main mouse button. I googled, and found out that this is a well known issue (not to me at the time of purchase) for many many years and Logitech continues to push out this mouse with the issue to save money. DO NOT buy this mouse. it will turn into an expensive paper weight FAR before it should."
Alex,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2020","DO NOT BUY!

To begin with, my mouse developed the double clicking issue that these mice are becoming famous for. When I sent it in for warranty service, I thought I'd be getting my overpriced mouse back in a few days. It's now been over a month and STILL NO MOUSE. No clue how it could possibly take this long to provide me a replacement. I've emailed them multiple times, opened an additional ticket, and still have NO MOUSE.

Please, don't make the mistake I did and waste $150 on this worthless mouse. When it works, it's just fine. When it inevitably breaks from basic use, don't count on Logitech standing by their warranty. What a massive waste of money and time. I've always bought Logitech mice in the past, but certainly didn't go with them for my replacement."
Shehab S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021","UPDATE 2: Opposite to what I would expect, no immediate customer support from Logitech. I have been going through links to find the proper customer support for my issue. This might cause me to refrain buy or even recommend the brand in the future.
UPDATE: 1 Star!! For such an expensive mouse, I am surprised that of all issues, this is what I came across. The right-click button is either too sensitive or broken. It clicks too fast (or two times) when gently clicked. That has caused an issue for me during gameplay and photo-editing.

This mouse rocks dude! Definitely was worth the switch (from razer atheris). The app made for the mouse is much better than razer's."
L. Thompson,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2021","I'd worn out the rubber grips on my MX Master again, so went to replace it and hopefully upgrade, but this mouse, while looking snazzy, is definitely NOT an upgrade - it's fine for normal mousing, but I've got slightly larger hands and this mouse is very light (even with all the weights in), and feels ""flimsy"", plus the scrollwheel doesn't have an easily-pressed freescroll button like the MX Master does. It feels like it's made for younger users who don't know that there's a better version out there, and it's more expensive to boot.

I'll keep it for an emergency backup mouse, but I'm going to buy another MX Master to replace my old one."
Kevin Dou,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2020","Upgrading from the wired g502. The mouse itself is great but lgs no longer supports the lightspeed. Instead you are forced to use the buggy ghub software. The current software has connection problems that can be fixed occasionally by restarting the software or the computer, but will also frequently default the programmable buttons to their default function. I’ve programmed several buttons which I use for mmo and dps gaming, and when the software allows the mouse to function properly, it works great, just like my old wired g502. When it doesn’t, the two index buttons on the left of left click will default to dpi up and down, randomly changing my sensitivity.

This mouse is useless with the current ghub limitations. A definite do not buy until lgs supports this or until ghub is fixed."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","I saw a few others mention this but disregarded it; sadly this was a bad call. Bought the mouse to play Escape from Tarkov and it is unplayable. When tapping the right mouse button (to aim) it double-clicks about 50% of the time, causing you to aim down sights then immediately stop. This means if you suddenly need to aim because you encounter another player, it'll cause you to stutter when aiming and will delay things by a few seconds, which is ample enough time for the other player to kill you. After several frustrating deaths I had to go back to my wired G502 which works perfectly with the same game. (for those who know the game, I DID try to set ""aim"" to ""continuous"" and I still had the same problem."
f82la01a,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2023","Logitech's G Hub software does not install on my Mac (OS 13.5). Upon doing some googling, the software seems to be pretty buggy and prone to breaking. Logitech's support is not responsive either. I'll be returning this and looking for a mouse that I'm actually able to program."
RAHAlpha,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","I read reviews and watched them on YouTube and I thought this was going to be a great mouse. Don't believe everything your read or watch. The whole thing feels like cheap plastic; like a low end one might. The scroll wheel, when on the click setting, feels heavy and stiff and like it will break any minute. The left/right buttons don't inspire confidence either.
The worst thing though is that, when I tried to program it in G Hub, it would lock up and I'd have to force-close G Hub to get back out. I've used G Hub for a long time with a keyboard and had no problems so the problem must be with the mouse.
Bottom line: Not recommended (But maybe you'd think differently)."

Andrew Rivers,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2020","This mouse is not only the most expensive I've ever owned, but by far the worst quality. I'm not even comparing it based on how much it costs... I've literally used $7 mice made in a factory in China (Just like Logitech does anyway) and it had 10x the percision and accuracy of this POS. I feel like I was scammed out of my money using this product... and am just paying Logitech's marketing team. If you want a mouse good for gaming, DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE. You will spend hours and hours just trying to fix settings trying to find a reason to not blame the mouse, to ultimately conclude you have a literal piece of poop in your hands."
Cullen,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020","After a very short period time of using this mouse, it had already developed a major issue when it comes to gaming. The right-click button on the mouse will not hold even when you are physically holding the button down, instead, the holding of the button causing an awkward pulsing of the signal like the button/sensor has gone bad already (this happened within 3-4 months of ownership). Seems to me like there is a hardware problem as when searching the forums there are plenty of other people with the same problem. I love the mouse and the ergonomics, but with such a horrible hardware issue there is no way I can suggest this mouse to others."
Colin,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2022","I ordered this mouse about 8 months ago and it is already having the same double click issue as the G502 (wired version) that I had before this wireless one. It constantly registers me holding down the right mouse button as a double click, which makes it very frustrating to game with.

A $100+ ""premium"" mouse should have a longer shelf life than 8 months. For what it's worth, it felt great while it lasted."
Duncan M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 26, 2023","Noisy, mushy scrollwheel. The infinite scrolling feature is nice, but every time I move the mouse the wheel rattles around and makes this awful noise that's impossible to ignore. Will ultimately be returning.

Rob M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020","It is quite clear now that Logitech used cheap switches on this and other mice product. I have a few buttons that randomly double click - they activate once when pressed down, once when released. But not all the time. A quick google search will show hundreds of posts complaining of this issue, yet still no fix. I didn't know this before buying a supposedly high-end mouse.

I tried working with Logitech Support but they just sent me around in circles, never addressing the real issue and not providing an exchange. Do not buy this product unless you are prepared for a major hassle."
Brandon,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020","This mouse itself is fantastic, and is everything I could ask for. It's got tons of customizable buttons, a great sensor, an ergonomic grip, and a very sleek design. Unfortunately I ran into the infamous double-clicking issue (that's been plaguing Logitech mice for way too long now) after not even 2 months of use. If you're not familiar, after some wear (hardly any in my case) some of these mice will start doubling the click inputs and repeating them if the button is held. It is fantastically annoying. I've just left a post in the support section on Logitech's site, and have heard the process for filing a warranty is conveniently long. We'll see"
Connor,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2019","First of all, I will say this was a nice addition to the Logitech G Products. I currently own the G502, G502 Lightspeed, G910 keyboard, G933 headset, and Powerplay Mousepad. The only reason I am giving this a one star is because of the software needed to download to program the mouse. I have a pretty dang good computer but the second I open the software my CPU maxes out to 99% usage, everything in the program is non-responsive and it will just infuriate you. If G-hub sticks aroud I will never by a Logitech accessory again. If they make G-hub not pull your hair out bad I would switch this to 5 stars."
XYSD,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020","I wish I have read the 1-star review before buying the mouse. The mouse is pretty awesome but I got the double click issue in less than 2 months. Upon closer look, it seems that both clicking the left button and releasing the button may register a separate click event, which seems to be fairly common and discussed in reddit and other forums too. I have uploaded a video, and you need to turn on the volume to hear the sound of clicking and releasing the button. The issue happens at click 5-6, 13-14, 26-27, 42-43, 50-52 (triple click), 71-72, 74-75, 77-78, 92-93.
Considering that this is an expensive mouse, I think it is not worth it. Do yourself a favor and get another gaming mouse."
Tim,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2019","It started double clicking after a couple of weeks and has gotten progressively worse to the point that it is completely unreliable. Everything else about the mouse is fantastic. I have the wireless charger, so battery is never an issue, it feels great, and there are plenty of ergonomic buttons to use for macros or whatever else, but being completely unreliable and at a price point like this is an absolute joke. I am in contact with logitech support (I have tried a number of solutions to fix this so far). I have heard their customer service is good so hopefully they will replace this. What a joke."
D. Meek,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2023","Device failed after just three months, registering all left clicks as right clicks. Also right clicks as right clicks.

Stryker1050,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023","Bought this mouse brand new, and it is ""double clicking"" right out of the box.

Farrell Chase Keough,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2022","I just opened the mouse from the box and used it for about an hour.

Chouse,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2022","I could deal with the terrible ergonomics of this mouse, and the awful layout of the DPI switches, but this mouse is a pile of garbage for one main reason.

I returned the 502 for a 703 model, which worked fine for a couple months. Recently, the input lag and response from this mouse have degraded severely. I previously owned a G9x (for nearly a decade) and would highly suggest buying from another company. This has been an awful experience from the marketing to final product to support.

Sadly, I went deep on this one and bought the powerplay mat too. The double click issue is apparently somewhat common.

This is a common issue across their newer lightspeed mice, and some of their other newer mice too. Because of that, I can't recommend logitech products at the moment. Even the wired ones aren't safe from it."
