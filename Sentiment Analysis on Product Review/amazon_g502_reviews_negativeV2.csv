Mason Bradley,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024","I was told that this product was a good buy by many people. However, I ordered it NEW and it’s missing the right clicker and the entire wire"
Miya,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024","Box looked like it was opened before and taped up, it was meant to be a gift. Looks bad. This is the second time I bought this product. The product is fine and works nicely."
D. C. Ellis,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024","I ordered an Amazon “Renewed” version of the G502 from I-Tech Mall & paid more for one that said it was in “excellent” condition. On first glance I was happy that it looked clean but after I turned it over I noticed an extreme amount of wear on the glide pads, which impedes smooth movement of the mouse. Several buttons are intermittent & also stick & it just feels very worn out. I wish I would’ve spent the extra few dollars on a new one, as they were on sale at the time."
Dan Grey,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023","I am in the process of getting a refund, sadly, as I have just realized my mouse came with no weights! This review rating is for the REFURBISHED model I received, not the mouse itself, which is a great mouse so far - if only it had weights, I would be extremely pleased with it.

I like the layout, and the buttons work swell. I like these buttons more than others I have had in the past. I also don't notice that it isn't wireless, not a bit, thanks to the cloth cord (I'm used to cords from the 2000s, wirey and hard to move around in the heat of battle).

So disappointing, because I usually have great success with refurbished products, especially from Amazon. Hopefully they will fix it, in which case I will amend my review to reflect this. I am sure they will, honestly, based on past experience. But very disappointed so far this time!"
John Adams,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024",When I received it package was terrible mouse wheel didnt work it rotated but didnt scroll things on the computer
Nathan F.,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2023","I know the mouse was used. I’m ok with used. I bought refurbished but I don’t think it was even cleaned much less looked through.

The first picture shows the bottom of the mouse pulling apart. The second picture it’s hard to see but the side where your thumb rests has a big crater in it and is clearly worn out. The third picture show the wheel which is caked with something and it doesn’t click on any direction. The fourth picture shows one part of the braided cable that is coming apart. All in all this is the worst “refurbished” product I’ve ever seen. It is going back today."
jesus correa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024","el mouse es pésimo, es como si tuvieras un ladrillo conectado a tu pc así le quites las pesas que trae por debajo, le doy un punto bueno y es el scroll de manera desbloqueada, a la semana que lo compré las hormigas hicieron un nido en este mouse cosas que jamás me habían pasado en la vida.. para terminar el mouse es muy alto"
Jason,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2022","I like the mouse in general, and perhaps this is the price I pay for buying something refurbished, so maybe you should consider a brand new one instead. It appears I am forever cursed with mice that will not last longer than a year, since this is my 4th in as many years. It's comfortable, I like the customized weights in the base, it's responsive and customizable, but the left button switch is now sticking and/or clicking without being pressed. I work on my computer every day, and over the last week it's become clear that I need a new mouse, since this one is randomly double-clicking or button presses are lagging behind. I opened it up, blew out everything with compressed air, wiped the contacts down with isopropyl alcohol, and reassembled it without issue, to no avail. Maybe this time I can find a mouse that will last longer."
Khushbu,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024",I recevied mine in a small box its fine but i opened it the right button doesn't click and i though it would only have a few scratches not a whole button on working and toke long time to connect thunk it is damaged badly completely useless just buy brand new its better
Luis Ernesto Donoso,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","My son started using this mouse, for a eeek and that’s it"
James Hinger,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022","I ordered this mouse as a spare for my wireless as it had good reviews but made the mistake of ordering a refurbished one it just showed up today and i unboxed it and hooked it up to my laptop instantly the mouse curser started jumping all over the screen until finally darted to the top and would not respond, i unplugged it restarted my laptop and updated the firmware plugged it back in and same thing instantly! decided to try it on my desktop just in case and guess what same thing! lesson of the day don't buy refurbished junk and the cost to send it back considering purchase price makes it not worth the trouble so i guess its a good way to throw away $25."
David,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","I got the first mouse with a broken button, and got a replacement, the replacement is worked 2-3 month and started making problems, like double clicking, unable to drag items on the screen, had to buy a new mouse"
Mel,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","Left click is failing. Can't click and drag anything as it is constantly letting go. I cannot believe the amount of frustration caused just by not being able to click and hold to drag. I unfortunately bought this many years ago and never tested it because the mouse I got it to replace suddenly started working okay again, and now I can't return it. DO NOT BUY"
mohammed,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023",The wire is broken and the wire is not like the original mouse wire
Diego Padilla,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2022","Amazon Claims to professionaly inspect items but this is clearly a joke mouse did not work when i plugged it in and had visible signs of damage, also amazon claims to clean the refurbished items but it was packaged and sealed good but the product was dirty and not at all clean, i used to have the mouse and its great, but amazon did not do a good job with their claims. I am waiting on my replacement but I will think twice abouts their refurbished site"
Joseph Ferraro,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2019","What I received was clearly NOT “Refurbished” in quality or alike. Someone, the previous owner I assume, simply returned this used and it wasn’t inspected or cleaned by anyone. It’s gross. There are tiny hairs stuck to the bottom of the mouse, and clear signs of use on the grip pads. There’s even a splotch of something of liquid origin on the top. I’ve spent some good time cleaning this and now it’s ready to go. But, having order it yesterday and it arriving today as filthy as it is, Amazon needs to do a much better job verifying listings that claim items to be refurbished or renewed. This is nasty folks, beware."
Shoebee2,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2022",The G502 is known as one of the best mice ever. The problem with “renewed” ones is that they aren’t. Renewed that is. The buttons are all worn out and soft making it impossible to tell by feel when a click has been recorded. Teflon pads on bottom were worn and cracked. This mouse is worn out and not renewed in any way. What a rip off! Sending back.
Oleksandr Pokydko,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2022","UPD: Left mouse button started double click after 5 mounts, think 10 times before buying from this seller.

The mouse kinda works, but there was 0 refurbishment done to it. It came in stinky cardboard box with few stickers, crappy printed out instructions and mouse itself was very dirty. After deep cleaning it I found out that additional weights are missing. You hould expect worst from this seller, and probably will be safer to buy used mouse elsewhere."
Jesswu,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2023","do not buy this renewed product ..after 6 months using, it start to disconnect to the laptop.."
Joshua Ford,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023","Bought this 2 times. Thought the first one was a lemon. Nope. Just will not hold left click, at all. Selling broken garbage but hey its at a discount right? Just buy one new. Not worth the headache."
M M,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2022","decent quality mouse I guess, don't really care too much as long as they work. right mouse button came messed up so it doesn't usually stay ADS'd in FPS games and gets me killed, don't recommend buying it on the off chance you will have the same issue as me"
Riley,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2022","Because of the garbage packaging(the mouse was literally just put in a bag, inside of a large box) the mouse arrived with the MMB broken into the mouse, it doesn't function correctly and its two extra side buttons didn't work either. DON'T BOTHER, spend a little more to get a new one that comes in its actual packaging."
Brett,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2021","Not impressed at all, i will never buy a renewed product again, rather spend the little extra and get new.
Product did not work at all.

Side note , Amazon did an amazing job and the package was collected 1 hour after i logged the fault.
I was refunded a couple of days later.
You guys are amazing."
Joshua Philipovich,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2022",I usually don't shop logitech due to their products just not being for me but I decided I'd give this mouse a try and it came to me with a scroll wheel that constantly was scrolling down.
Zackary,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2022","I saw that they offer refurbished ones, so I figured why not save a buck? I think they forgot to actually refurbish it. The middle button doesn't click, and the mouse wheel scrolls in the wrong direction half the time. At least it came with a built in fidget spinner"
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023","Really in poor condition, a broken button, worn, sweat scabs in small places, rubber bands on the bottom detached."
Bobbie Oblinsky,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023",Ended up sending it back

Angie p.,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2022",It looks used already! Is not new
David Antolic,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021","Great functionality, but the left click began to fail after only a few months of use as if it were some non name brand from Wish. I will never buy Logitech again."

Ross Wagner,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2019","Right click button worked every so often within the first month, thought it was pc related until I swapped out the mouse. Don't bother with a refurb they won't stand by and will flat out ignore return requests."
YOSHIKI,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019","Case was crap. it looks like picked up from junk box.

when connecting mouse, the mouse cable heating very hot and computer doesn't recognized the mouse.

tried to Macbook, and it says Too much power.

this product trying to destroy your computer."
Kenny Powers,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020",Don’t waste your time with “renewed” version from Amazon. Mine was beat up and didn’t even include the weights which I consider to be essential. They were supposed to be included.
Andrew,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2022",It’s definitely used
S. Pauken,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2023",This is the worst piece of junk I've ever owned. The buttons are unresponsive and instead do random things and glitch out on their own. The Amazon Basics mouse is better than this. Into the trash this goes.
aasdasdasdasdasdasdasdads,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2022","G5/ MX500 / G500 / G501 all decent mice. This mouse, the skates fall off, the handles fall off, the scroll wheel goes off-sync to the motion, and it's just a total disappointment to someone who expected quality."
Andrey,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020","Returning, because the logitech software is unusable, doesn't recognize the mouse on any computer. No setup available. Battling some half-cooked product is not my cup of tea."
