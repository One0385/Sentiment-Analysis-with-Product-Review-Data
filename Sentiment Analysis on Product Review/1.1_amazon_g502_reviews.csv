Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it.

OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard

MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."

Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight.

Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing.

The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price!

mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI.

James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."

The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."
Ragnarok,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",Have bought the same mouse for my setup at work. Coworker wanted the same one. No issues as far as usage or connection. Just plug and play. Don’t loose the weights
Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."
Hero 1133,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I have had many $90 and hundred dollar overpriced razer mice all my PC life so I didn't expect this to surpass my expectations but it did the design makes it so comfy for gaming for hours and I also work from home so no more pain from clicking super fast also the illuminated G is such a nice touch great design from logitech
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."
Kirvic L. Aguilera,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",This is the best gaming mouse I ever had and this one was a gift for my son who is now happy with it.
Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","I love this mouse, the size, the shape, button placement, just about everything except.... with too much use, the left and right buttons die after a while.. Had to replace it after about 2.5 years. lucky for me the replacement was 50% off at the time.

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

IF it happens again i'll need to look for a mouse that can actually stand up to thousands of hours of gaming. LOL

I would guess if you're not to rough with it, it will last a long time."
tiffany,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024",I asked my gamer friends what mouse to get and they said this one and that everyone gets this one so yeah lol
Erik,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","I have used this series of mouse since early 2000's. It has always been reliable, and only reason I have had to replace them is from external debris like soda or such being spilled on it. I have an extra one always, incase they ever stop being produced"
Dan S,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024",I love this mouse!! It's amazing! The variable weights are such an awesome touch!! I cant recommend this mouse enough
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024","I'm rough on my mouse when I play certain games. Definitely the best mouse I've ever bought, it's got plenty of extra buttons and speed adjustments as well as weights to put in it. I put all the weights in for the heavier feel and i feel more stability"
Edgar Rodriguez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024","Buen accesorio el peso, mala posición de la luz led, no sirve de nada ponerle variación en la luz si la tapas con la palma de la mano.

shannon,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024",Very reliable and precise mouse. LOVE USING IT.I would buy another one for my home computer.
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024",I used a death adder for about 8 years and decided to purchase this as a replacement and I am very happy with the results. The quality of the mouse is very good. The size of it fits very well in my hand and it is not too heavy either. Very happy with my choice to switch and have recommended it to my friends as well.
Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."
taz b.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Feels great for fps games, I use it with all of the weights and have mapped the buttons to my liking, perfect mouse in my opinion"
Christopher E.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024","The G502 Hero gaming mouse is an absolute powerhouse. With its precise sensor, customizable weight system, and ergonomic design, it's a dream for gamers. Its programmable buttons provide unparalleled control, and the DPI settings ensure smooth and accurate movement in any game. Overall, it's a top-notch choice for anyone serious about gaming."

San Phu Ngoc,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I really like this product because I got it on discount for 40 dollars off so I knew this was good. I really like the features on this and you can also customize how heavy/light it is
Nadeem J,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024",Very good gaming mouse with customized buttons. Works great for everything.
zachary spahr,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","mouse is good, if you are just looking for a plug and play solution it works great.

if you were hoping to setup profiles and macros you need to be a bit patient. I haven't had the best luck with the ghub software but I'm willing to bet with a little research that would be good too."
JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

Nathanail,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","This mouse has everything you could need ergonomics wise and feels great no matter how your hold your mouse. The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing. From adjusting the weight and an unlockable scroll wheel, to customizing the DPI and colors of the lights, you can do anything you want with this mouse. The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

dillon,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024",It’s an awesome gaming mouse. The weights in the bottom really help. After getting used to it I feel like I game better with it. Definitely recommend
Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024",great mouse for the price but its really touchy when using the scroll wheel sometimes just moving the mouse moves the scroll wheel on its own
Phillip J. Fry,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","I have owned this for around a year and I have to say, I absolutely enjoy it. The optional software is very useful for keybinds, and it comes included with weights if you like a heavy mouse. For what I payed it's BY FAR worth it"

Tom,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","I have a Gen 1 from 2014 when they first released these and I've used it so much that friction wore through the slick plastic glide pads on the bottom of it. That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."
Julius,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024",I was having issues with the wireless version of this mouse glitching during use. I bought the wired version of the mouse and so far it is the best mouse I've used to date. Highly recommend the wired version. The wire itself is very non-intrusive. You don't even know it's there. Love this mouse.
theterminator27,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","I liked that this mouse didn't feel empty/hollow like a lot of other gaming mouses I have used, they even come with some weights to put in the mouse if you feel its too light which is nice.
My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."

El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led.

Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk.

DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.

The quality of the mouse is very good. The size of it fits very well in my hand and it is not too heavy either. Very happy with my choice to switch and have recommended it to my friends as well.
Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."

mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay.

It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."

mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."

Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."
Ragnarok,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",Have bought the same mouse for my setup at work. Coworker wanted the same one. No issues as far as usage or connection. Just plug and play. Don’t loose the weights
Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."
Hero 1133,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I have had many $90 and hundred dollar overpriced razer mice all my PC life so I didn't expect this to surpass my expectations but it did the design makes it so comfy for gaming for hours and I also work from home so no more pain from clicking super fast also the illuminated G is such a nice touch great design from logitech
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."
Kirvic L. Aguilera,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",This is the best gaming mouse I ever had and this one was a gift for my son who is now happy with it.

Had to replace it after about 2.5 years. lucky for me the replacement was 50% off at the time.

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

IF it happens again i'll need to look for a mouse that can actually stand up to thousands of hours of gaming. LOL

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."
taz b.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Feels great for fps games, I use it with all of the weights and have mapped the buttons to my liking, perfect mouse in my opinion"

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing.

The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."
Julius,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024",I was having issues with the wireless version of this mouse glitching during use. I bought the wired version of the mouse and so far it is the best mouse I've used to date. Highly recommend the wired version. The wire itself is very non-intrusive. You don't even know it's there. Love this mouse.
theterminator27,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","I liked that this mouse didn't feel empty/hollow like a lot of other gaming mouses I have used, they even come with some weights to put in the mouse if you feel its too light which is nice.
My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

Customization Galore:

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."

J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:

DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.

I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect.

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay.

It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."

Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing.

The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay.

It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI.

James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."

Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"

The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well.

DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.

I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect.

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it.

MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."

Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight.

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.

It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."

mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."

mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."

There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."

The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."
Ragnarok,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",Have bought the same mouse for my setup at work. Coworker wanted the same one. No issues as far as usage or connection. Just plug and play. Don’t loose the weights
Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."
Hero 1133,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I have had many $90 and hundred dollar overpriced razer mice all my PC life so I didn't expect this to surpass my expectations but it did the design makes it so comfy for gaming for hours and I also work from home so no more pain from clicking super fast also the illuminated G is such a nice touch great design from logitech
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."
Kirvic L. Aguilera,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",This is the best gaming mouse I ever had and this one was a gift for my son who is now happy with it.
Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","I love this mouse, the size, the shape, button placement, just about everything except.... with too much use, the left and right buttons die after a while.. Had to replace it after about 2.5 years. lucky for me the replacement was 50% off at the time.

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

IF it happens again i'll need to look for a mouse that can actually stand up to thousands of hours of gaming. LOL

I would guess if you're not to rough with it, it will last a long time."

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."
taz b.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Feels great for fps games, I use it with all of the weights and have mapped the buttons to my liking, perfect mouse in my opinion"

zachary spahr,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","mouse is good, if you are just looking for a plug and play solution it works great.

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing. From adjusting the weight and an unlockable scroll wheel, to customizing the DPI and colors of the lights, you can do anything you want with this mouse. The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."
Julius,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024",I was having issues with the wireless version of this mouse glitching during use.

Love this mouse.
theterminator27,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","I liked that this mouse didn't feel empty/hollow like a lot of other gaming mouses I have used, they even come with some weights to put in the mouse if you feel its too light which is nice.
My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable.

También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien.

J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:

DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.

With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."

Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect.

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse. It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."
Ragnarok,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",Have bought the same mouse for my setup at work. Coworker wanted the same one. No issues as far as usage or connection. Just plug and play. Don’t loose the weights
Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."
Hero 1133,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I have had many $90 and hundred dollar overpriced razer mice all my PC life so I didn't expect this to surpass my expectations but it did the design makes it so comfy for gaming for hours and I also work from home so no more pain from clicking super fast also the illuminated G is such a nice touch great design from logitech
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."
Kirvic L. Aguilera,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",This is the best gaming mouse I ever had and this one was a gift for my son who is now happy with it.

Had to replace it after about 2.5 years. lucky for me the replacement was 50% off at the time.

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

IF it happens again i'll need to look for a mouse that can actually stand up to thousands of hours of gaming. LOL

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."
taz b.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Feels great for fps games, I use it with all of the weights and have mapped the buttons to my liking, perfect mouse in my opinion"

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing. From adjusting the weight and an unlockable scroll wheel, to customizing the DPI and colors of the lights, you can do anything you want with this mouse. The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."

The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay.

It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."

Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."

Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"

MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.

I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect.

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."

tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it.

MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."

I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.

It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it.

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing. From adjusting the weight and an unlockable scroll wheel, to customizing the DPI and colors of the lights, you can do anything you want with this mouse. The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay. The onboard memory allows me to save multiple profiles, ensuring that my settings are always at my fingertips, no matter where I game.

The G502 HERO also boasts a customizable RGB lighting system, allowing me to personalize the look of my mouse to match my gaming setup. Whether I prefer a subtle glow or a vibrant light show, the options are virtually endless.

Plus, with Logitech's renowned build quality and reliability, I have full confidence that this mouse will serve me well for years to come.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse. It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."

mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI.

James A.

There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."

The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."
Ragnarok,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",Have bought the same mouse for my setup at work. Coworker wanted the same one. No issues as far as usage or connection. Just plug and play. Don’t loose the weights
Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."
Hero 1133,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I have had many $90 and hundred dollar overpriced razer mice all my PC life so I didn't expect this to surpass my expectations but it did the design makes it so comfy for gaming for hours and I also work from home so no more pain from clicking super fast also the illuminated G is such a nice touch great design from logitech
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."
Kirvic L. Aguilera,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",This is the best gaming mouse I ever had and this one was a gift for my son who is now happy with it.
Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2024","I love this mouse, the size, the shape, button placement, just about everything except.... with too much use, the left and right buttons die after a while.. Had to replace it after about 2.5 years. lucky for me the replacement was 50% off at the time.

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

IF it happens again i'll need to look for a mouse that can actually stand up to thousands of hours of gaming. LOL

I would guess if you're not to rough with it, it will last a long time."

Erik,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","I have used this series of mouse since early 2000's. It has always been reliable, and only reason I have had to replace them is from external debris like soda or such being spilled on it. I have an extra one always, incase they ever stop being produced"
Dan S,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024",I love this mouse!! It's amazing! The variable weights are such an awesome touch!! I cant recommend this mouse enough
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024","I'm rough on my mouse when I play certain games.

I put all the weights in for the heavier feel and i feel more stability"
Edgar Rodriguez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024","Buen accesorio el peso, mala posición de la luz led, no sirve de nada ponerle variación en la luz si la tapas con la palma de la mano.

Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024",I used a death adder for about 8 years and decided to purchase this as a replacement and I am very happy with the results. The quality of the mouse is very good. The size of it fits very well in my hand and it is not too heavy either. Very happy with my choice to switch and have recommended it to my friends as well.
Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."
taz b.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Feels great for fps games, I use it with all of the weights and have mapped the buttons to my liking, perfect mouse in my opinion"
Christopher E.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024","The G502 Hero gaming mouse is an absolute powerhouse.

San Phu Ngoc,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I really like this product because I got it on discount for 40 dollars off so I knew this was good. I really like the features on this and you can also customize how heavy/light it is
Nadeem J,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024",Very good gaming mouse with customized buttons. Works great for everything.
zachary spahr,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","mouse is good, if you are just looking for a plug and play solution it works great.

if you were hoping to setup profiles and macros you need to be a bit patient. I haven't had the best luck with the ghub software but I'm willing to bet with a little research that would be good too."
JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

Nathanail,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","This mouse has everything you could need ergonomics wise and feels great no matter how your hold your mouse. The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing. From adjusting the weight and an unlockable scroll wheel, to customizing the DPI and colors of the lights, you can do anything you want with this mouse. The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

dillon,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024",It’s an awesome gaming mouse. The weights in the bottom really help. After getting used to it I feel like I game better with it. Definitely recommend
Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024",great mouse for the price but its really touchy when using the scroll wheel sometimes just moving the mouse moves the scroll wheel on its own
Phillip J. Fry,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024","I have owned this for around a year and I have to say, I absolutely enjoy it. The optional software is very useful for keybinds, and it comes included with weights if you like a heavy mouse. For what I payed it's BY FAR worth it"

That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."
Julius,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024",I was having issues with the wireless version of this mouse glitching during use.

Love this mouse.
theterminator27,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","I liked that this mouse didn't feel empty/hollow like a lot of other gaming mouses I have used, they even come with some weights to put in the mouse if you feel its too light which is nice.
My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."

Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."

Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."
P.Y.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024","purchased this gaming mouse as a gift for my son to upgrade his old Logitech wireless mouse, and I'm thrilled with the value I got at a discounted price! My son is absolutely loving his new mouse, praising its precision and customizable buttons that enhance his gaming experience.
He particularly appreciates the included weights that allow him to adjust the mouse's center of gravity to suit his playing style. As his first gaming mouse, it's exceeded his expectations and mine!"
mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."

El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."

Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk.

Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well.

DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.

It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games.

The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."

I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect.

ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."

My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."

Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Ebbyman,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022","For the last 2 years, I used a HyperX Pulsefire Raid. You can read my review on it, but the mouse wheel failed only after 2 years, prompting me to switch brands back to Logitech as I need a mouse with more buttons than the typical FPS gaming mouse.

I have an older G502 Proteus Core ('the Core'), which I used as a back until the G502 Hero came. They are pretty much the same shape design. Only a couple of differences with the hardware. First, the Hero as a way better cable than the Core. This is hands down. However, the Core's mouse wheel is better despite looking exactly the same. I never had an issue with scrolling with the Core for the handful of years I used it, but the Hero's mouse wheel is for a lack of better work, 'slippery'. I have/had (more on that later) getting finger grip on it to turn it effortlessly. I never remember having an issue with Core and from my side by side, the Core is easier because the detents are less pronounced.

I have larger than average hands and I will say I miss the general form factor of the Pulsefire Raid a lot. It was very comfortable for me to hold. Going back to the G502 design, my hand feels 'crampy' holding it too long as my fingers just don't lay on it the same way. Side by side, the Pulsefire Raid only looks ever so slightly wider, but the design is a little more square and my hand lays on it just right.

In terms of tracking, the Hero feels way better than the Core and the Pulsefire Raid. Interestingly, the Pulsefire Raid actually glides smoother in my opinion, but I think Hero has slightly more friction, but that is actually helpful to me. I did an aim reflex test in a aim practice app and I actually did better with the Hero than the Pulsefire Raid (after using this mouse for 2 years). I think a combination of a better sensor and the slightly more friction (ie; stopping speed) made the Hero better for me.

Regarding the mouse wheel on the Hero, I decided to take a risk and try something to improve the grip on the wheel. The risk was basically the $40 because I would not be able to consciously and fairly return it after my 'mod'. Ultimately, I ended up using a Dremel tool with pretty course sand paper attachment. This was not a disk, but a barrel form factor so it spun 100% horizontal over the notches. I lightly swiped (not a press or a tap, your are not sanding, just a slight pass over once or twice to create 'texture') over each knob while holding the mouse upside down to prevent any shavings going into the mouse. Note and very important, if you were to attempt this, wear safety glasses. I always wear them when working with any tools and I did feel some particles hit my face doing this. You really do not want these metal shavings in your eyes. Overall, this really did the trick for me and the mouse wheel is way better. I attached a picture to see generally what if looks like now, but this change makes the mouse a keeper for me. I was considering finding another mouse because the mouse wheel for me was not good.

So overall for me and my uses and having to mod the mouse wheel, which took all of 5 minutes only, I am rating this mouse a 4. The mouse is too small for my hand, but I will need to adjust and the mouse wheel is surprisingly bad out of the box, but it performs well and my aim tests showed the potential it has for me."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay.

It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

Seamless Integration:
Logitech's G HUB software provides intuitive control over every aspect of the G502 HERO. From adjusting DPI settings to creating custom profiles for different games, the software offers unparalleled flexibility and ease of use. With automatic game detection and onboard memory to store your preferences, you can jump into your favorite games without missing a beat."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."
Bert in Chicago who is a happy and loyal Amazon Customer. :-),,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","Hello,

I own several Logitech devices. They are:

Gamepad/Controller: F710 and F310
Camera: C910
Headset: G933
Keyboard: G105
Mouse: G502 Hero

The Logitech G Hub software I use for the Keyboard and Headset is 8.82.151. The camera has its own and I have to run an old version of Logitech Gaming Software (5.10) for the F710 and F310.

I open the package for the G502 Hero mouse and find:

1) The mouse
2) A small sheet of page with four diagrams on it. They are:
2A) A drawing of an USB plug going into a computer.
2B) A computer with a URL: logitechG.com/support/G502-HERO
2C) Two hands holding an opened mouse. (No drawing or words to tell you how to open the mouse.)
2D) Something being inserted into the SIDE of the mouse.
3) A black 6 sided box.

When I go to the URL, I'm taken to the default Logitech support page for ALL Products. From the URL, I thought it would take me to the support page for the G502-HERO (but it doesn't - why?).

I decided to contact Logitech support. First I try chat, but because I can't find the serial number I'm asked for the product model. When I tell it I have a mouse up comes a list for all the mice. Unfortunately, the G502-HERO is not on the list. The ""Logitech Assistant"" simply keeps asking me about my product. I tell it is a mouse. It gives me a list that doesn't include the G502-HERO. This never ends. It won't let me talk to an agent until I. Well, I'm not sure how to fix the Logitech Assistant. (Why could I type in G502-HERO and it would recognize it. I tried typing in G502-HERO but the assistant ignored me.)

In the end, I decide to call Logitech. The phone system works great and in under a minute I'm talking to a real life person. She want to help me. Outstanding! She listens to all the issues about the packaging, the URL, etc. Quickly, she send, to my email containing four links:

1) The G502-HERO manual. I've yet to read it.
2) The G-Hub manual.
3) The G502-HERO downloads.
4) The G502-HERO FAQ list.

I start the version of G-Hub I am using for the keyboard and headset. It doesn't recognize the mouse.

She asks me to download the latest version of G-Hub. I'm on version 8.82.151.

I comply downloading and then starting the installation process. It wants to restart the system. OK, I restart the computer. After logging back into Windows, nothing happens. The G Hub software is still at 8.82.151. Ah! Why did I have to restart? What was the purpose of the restart. Nothing looks different, so why the restart?

The Logitech support person says to start the installer again. It stops IMMEDIATELY saying there is an older version on the system and can't continue. WHAT THE F*******?

Honestly:
** Why couldn't the installer say this before having me do a restart?
** Why can't the new installer uninstall the old version and MIGRATE my existing configurations?

It is at this point she says the new version (9 something) might not destroy my existing configurations. Why? She thinks the manual uninstall of 8.82.151 will erase/destroy my existing configuration OR maybe the new version will do it. This would means I would not be able to use my keyboard, headset, or game controller. She is pretty sure the camera will continue to work.

She offers to open a ticket for those above her and I should hear back in 3 day to a week either via email or a phone call.

She can't even tell me if the new G-Hub supports my existing devices. I might have to replace all my Logitech devices with new hardware (forced obsolescence), it seems to me.

Thing is the F710 and F310 are the only game controller Logitech is selling. (I use the controller for several games, including Final Fantasy XI and Alpha Prison (on Steam).) I use the headset with Discord, games, etc. I have configured the keyboard for lots of various stuff. Why shouldn't Logitech provide a migration path for people with older Logitech gear?

I don't have an end to this story / issue / review, yet. All I know is this mouse - right now - doesn't do anything more than a simple ball mouse. I can't enable the higher DPI support or any button. Finally, I still don't understand drawings 3 and 4 or know what I'm suppose to do with the 6 sided thing.

Bottom line: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

***> The printed documentation doesn't make sense and doesn't have an URL for the product (you just go to the default support page for all products).
***> There seems to be serious lack of support for your past purchases with Logitech's G-Hub.
***> Why can't Logitech developers uninstall past versions and insure you don't lose your existing configuration?

I will update this review should Logitech get back to me. I'll gladly let you know how it goes.

UPDATE 1: I have yet to hear back from Logitech support on my software issues. The mouse is running in default mode. I have seen two hardware issues.

1) I changed out my Logitech G105 keyboard for a Dell KB522, which has an internal 2 port USB 2.0 hub. I booted my Dell T7910 and went into the BIOS (where my Razer mouse failed), but this Logitech mouse worked great! It moved and the G was lit.

The problems with the Logitech mouse started after the system booted to Windows 10 and presented the login screen. The G on the mouse never lit and the cursor never appeared on the screen. Only after I plugged in my Dell Optical mouse (with the tracking problem) did the cursor appear on the Windows login screen.

I did get the mouse to appear by plugging it into my Amazon Basic 7 port USB 2.0 hub. Maybe it is a power issue, but Logitech doesn't say the mouse has unusual power requirements.

2) The wheel is overly sensitive for scrolling on webpages and other programs. I'm hoping I can adjust this through the software (whenever Logitech can get back to me with a solution).

Again the bottom line hasn't changed: The G502-HERO is not ready for normal people.

Final update: Logitech got back to me with all the answers on day 35! I thought about returning it to Amazon on day 30, but realized I couldn't get to UPS before the UPS store closed.

Logitech got the mouse working but the G105 keyboard stopped working. Several days later and I'm told the new GHub no longer supports the G105. The answer is yet another piece of software to run.

Why can't Logitech create a single interface for all their software / products (old and current)? Aren't customers returning worth it?"
Pam Myer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","The G502 was released 10 years ago. It's been one of the most popular gaming mice made by Logitech.
It has an excellent feel, textured thumb rest, programmable DPI, customizable weights, and an unlockable scroll wheel for free-spinning fun.
All in all, it's a mouse you just can't go wrong buying.
So, why the 4 stars?
Simple. Not long after the G502 was released, I got my hands on one. It was all I'd wanted in a gaming mouse. It lasted me close to 10 years, only losing the MMB functionality along the way (I put this thing through the wringer!), and the nylon-wrapped cord frayed slightly from rubbing against my desk all that time.
This one that I bought to replace it is the G502 Hero. An upgraded version.
Imagine my shock when the upgrade included a downgrade to a bare cord. No nylon-wrapping to protect it. Just a boring, old, mouse cord.
I can't take .5 stars, so I just took 1 star so people would know that it's a great gaming mouse, but the cord on the old G502 was better."

mweishaa,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","I do play some games, but I don't really use all the buttons on this mouse. I got it for 2 reasons - the adjustable dpi, and the hyper scroll. I had tried another mouse without this scroll, and I only lasted a couple of weeks and then had to get this one. But I do have a couple of issues. 1. the mouse wheel is slick. Slippery even. I don't understand why this wheel doesn't have the rubber on it like other logitech mice. (I use a wireless one for work) So I had to drop a star for that, and even considered 2 because it's such an important feature. 2. the software is pretty terrible. It's not intuitive at all. But I was able to figure it out after a bit of fiddling. Thankfully I can turn down the lighting to where it's barely on (it's just not my thing). I like the adjustable weights too. I'm not sure why it doesn't have a braided cable. It's a pretty good value since I don't really need a full-blown gaming mouse. It's a little narrow for my liking, but it gets the job done. Overall, pretty happy with it as long as I can get use to the slippy wheel."
Ian M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","I love this mouse, the thumb button dedicated to turning down the DPI can be really useful for clicking small buttons or when playing a video game to aim. All of the buttons on the mouse are programmable with Logitech G Hub even the left and right click, you can also make your own custom macros to apply to the buttons, allowing you to create an autoclicker that toggles on and off and many more possible configurations. The ability to change the weight of the mouse was a highlight, with custom weights that come with it and a magnetic bottom plate allowing you to change your configuration with no screws or time wasted. I would highly recommend this mouse. Also it doesn't have a battery life, as it's a wired one."
Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!
Recommended this mouse to over a dozen friends and so far I haven't heard of one that returned it, this mouse will last you a long time before you even have to consider replacing it."
Levi,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024","Excellent price for a high quality to medium quality gaming mouse I believe it's 27,000 DPI. My child uses it for gaming and there is no lag at all on any of his games. He's running a G-Force 3060 graphics card and an i5 core processor running and high speed Samsung monitor absolutely zero lag. Good product good price."
James A. Boone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","There are occasions when the resolution will change on a whim a lot of times and I don't have any idea what causes it, but the misfunction will last for days. There is an easy fix to this most disturbing function of this mouse, make the resolution function dependent on a pin connector similar to the old hard-drive pins we had to set for primary or secondary drive, and put it in the base of the mouse with the weights. I like the weights because I can get just the way I want it. Fix that and I will go back up to 5 stars because that front button is crap for something like that, and we can use that button for something else in gaming."
Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."
J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Caleb Kuester,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024","Bought two for home and one for work. For $40, simply can't beat it. I can't live without the fidget spinner-esque mouse wheel feature since, as a software developer, I find myself scrolling between top and bottom often. As a gamer, it's rarely useful though.

I've blown-out several Razer mice with clicks and will never go back despite lifetime warranties, but a couple of these have lasted several years under heavy load without a single issue.

I don't care about the weights, but it's an interesting thing to have."

Cliffton Mcintire,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","My first major problem is fundamental: it has 5 customizable settings _in your PC's memory_. If you're not running their software on a supported OS you only get 1.

That problem causes other problems, too: I sometimes have moments where my mouse picks up its default (hardware-stored) settings or one of the other custom sets, can't tell, then switches back when its software pushes out the right settings again. This is on Windows 11 on newish workstation, that's a bug.

My other major problem is hand fit. I'm always hitting the wrong buttons - 3 in particular. There's a button at the top of my thumb that I can't avoid because I'm already resting my thumb on the curve at the bottom. There's another big button at the end of my thumb that means my palm can't ever touch the mouse or I'm too far forward for my thumb. I palm my mouse, I had to disable that button, but it's still disconcerting to always be clicking something accidentally, it throws bumps into my flow. The other disagreeable button is the one to change your profile, it's up top between your index and middle knuckles. I don't know how I hit it, I can't tell when I hit it, but I'm always hitting it, sometimes 2 or 3 times in quick succession, and then my mouse starts leaping all over the screen, or slows to a tiny crawl.

Which leads me into another big annoyance. That profile-switch button can't be relocated to a directional kind of button. There's no fwd-rev, it can't be put on the click wheel. When you want to change profiles you have to click-forward. If you go forward 1 profile, then want to go back 1, you have to go forward 4 more, or turn off the other 3. Ugh.

Too bad it sucks for some kinds of hands and is a little too active, because it seems like a quality build. The free-scroll has a nice fast spin despite a nice-feeling 'heft', and when in click mode the wheel has just the right granularity and resistance. The cord is really thin and flexible and not too prone to tangling, though I think one chomp from my cat might do it in. We _will_ find out soon enough."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","As an avid gamer, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Logitech G502 HERO, and let me tell you—it’s a game-changer! Here’s why:
Precision and Responsiveness: The HERO 25K sensor is nothing short of impressive. With sub-micron precision tracking, my cursor glides effortlessly across the screen. Whether I’m sniping in an FPS or navigating intricate spreadsheets, the G502 delivers pinpoint accuracy.
Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.
Ergonomic Design: The G502 fits like a glove."
Ariel Dilone,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","Es un muy buen Mouse para Gaming y uso general, si bien es cierto que es algo pesado comparado con otros Mouse en el mercado, una vez te acostumbras o si ya de por si te gusta que sea algo pesado esta muy bien. El único problema real que encontré es que no esta disponible el software Logitech G HUB para Sistemas Operativos Linux, por lo que como alternativa recomiendo utilizar Piper para la configuración de perfiles, DPI/Resolución, Botones y Luces Led. Incluso para las Led se puede usar OpenRGB el cual también permite administrar las luces led."
Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it. The buttons are pretty light so I accidentally click them when resting and the dpi arrows are a little too easy to bump. Other than the little things, it’s perfect"
OTD,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","Awesome mouse. Bought because I wanted a programmable mouse to customize (I have hand arthritis and scrolls is hard
So I can customize scrolling directly from mouse buttons). Very pleased.east to program and use. High quality and the lights on it are joyful to look at."
MeganBound,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2024","I bought my first back in 2016 and since then, this has always been my go-to mouse. It's just solid, works/feels great, and last a long time. I'm a heavy mouse user between WFH, editing, and gaming & these usually last around 2 years before I start having left-clicking issues. The best thing is that these gave gotten more affordable over the years. I originally spent $60 on my first one and now you can usually find them for $30-40."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well. This is certainly a strong choice for those that wants something that just works and has some features for when you want to take things alittle further. 10/10 for sure and worth the payment."
DJ XybepteK,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","You may notice that the GHub software will not recognize this mouse. This is bad, since GHub is where you customize the mouse sensitivity and the RGB lighting (you can sync up the colors with the matching keyboard so they both display the same dancing colors at once). The solution I found, after hours of searching google, was that you have to right click the application (.exe file) and ""Run as Administrator"". It will show up just fine after that. And you have to do this each and every time you restart the computer. The ""automatically start when Windows starts"" feature will have to be turned off so you can manually run it as administrator... every time. It's been a problem for years, and Logitech support has even joined the online forums from time to time with nothing helpful to say. Other than that, it's a great mouse. Also just FYI, the small button in the middle, right below the roll/wheel is a toggle that goes between a roll that 'clicks' and is very controllable, and a roll that is smooth with no clicks, that I found to be impossible to control while scrolling through a list, or text on a webpage. The 'no click' roll seems to go non-stop forever and sends me 100 pages further down than I was wanting to go."
Patrick,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I loved the first one so much that when I built my daughter a gaming rig that this mouse was a must. Fortunately, she got a SE model for $25. I've been using mine for a few years now and it's my favorite mouse ever... I'm sure there are ""better"" units out there, but at what cost? Logitech gear has never failed me, and I've used a lot of it over the past 20+ years."
Ragnarok,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",Have bought the same mouse for my setup at work. Coworker wanted the same one. No issues as far as usage or connection. Just plug and play. Don’t loose the weights
Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.
Brad,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024","I purchased this on sale, my current mouse was dying. It feels very nice, moves smoothly and has a nice amount of buttons w/o being overwhelming. It was plug in play, no extra drivers. It seems super responsive, so far I'm very happy with it."
Sebastian,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024",This mouse is fantastic for gaming. As someone who lives out I'm the middle of nowhere when it is nasty out I play games. I also go to college. This mouse certainly isn't necessary for casual use or for casual gaming. Although if you are looking for a good mouse with a lot of custom options This is great. With the logitech app you are capable of setting up custom button options as well as macros. The sensitivity is more than customizable for any use you may need This mouse for. It is an adorable good option with a lot of options along with it.
Bell,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","Many others have shared similar praises to mine but it's honestly warranted, never are you using this mouse and feel like some aspect of it's design is too cheap or impractical. It's also pretty versatile for most games if you need to utilize a few of the extra buttons on the mouse.

Great mouse overall, it fits perfectly for my hands but I've been told it's kind of a bother if you got bigger hands."
Hero 1133,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",I have had many $90 and hundred dollar overpriced razer mice all my PC life so I didn't expect this to surpass my expectations but it did the design makes it so comfy for gaming for hours and I also work from home so no more pain from clicking super fast also the illuminated G is such a nice touch great design from logitech
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024","Great mouse, I like that you can change the weight. My only issue is the scroll wheel, as much fun as it is to just spin it around and around, the sensitivity of it means that you will get random scrolling as you move the mouse around. I’ve had to disable it in some games because of that."
Kirvic L. Aguilera,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",This is the best gaming mouse I ever had and this one was a gift for my son who is now happy with it.

Had to replace it after about 2.5 years. lucky for me the replacement was 50% off at the time.

I'm not the only person I know who has had this problem.

IF it happens again i'll need to look for a mouse that can actually stand up to thousands of hours of gaming. LOL

I would guess if you're not to rough with it, it will last a long time."

Tyler joseph mckee,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",This mouse is an excellent gaming mouse. So far it’s the best one I’ve ever owned. My most favorite part about this mouse is house versatile the wheel is. There is a button you can use to unlock the mouse that allows it to spin without any resistance which is perfect for some of the games I play. Also the amount of extra keys on the mouse makes key binding extremely easy and much better gameplay.
Abel Fernández,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","The only thing I can say ilthat I didn't like is the fact that the box came with some damages as you can see on the pictures, but I cannot complain with anything else.

Something that I really love and I never see people talking about it is that you can assign any button to make any action, so I used copy and paste, then back and forward and this is really nice for work I love this product."
Rob,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","The device is sturdy and can take quite a beating. It has lots of buttons to map and DPI settings and can save several different mapping profiles for different games. It even has nifty weights that can be added to the bottom which can help prevent losing sensor connection from lifting off the pad. It is by far my favorite mouse to use for any and all gaming.
The only flaw is the convoluted app that controls the button mapping and profile setting of the mouse. It seems unnecessarily difficult to use and can be quite frustrating."
taz b.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Feels great for fps games, I use it with all of the weights and have mapped the buttons to my liking, perfect mouse in my opinion"

zachary spahr,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2024","mouse is good, if you are just looking for a plug and play solution it works great.

JD,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","Ergos and the vast array of buttons work great. One glaring flaw, at least for me, is the wheel. Free-wheeling works great but when it's off there is too much resistance on the wheel. Since there isn't any rubber on the wheel my finger slides on the wheel when I roll it. My Logitech M570 has a wheel with a rubber inlay and it works great. Sadly, I wouldn't buy the G502 again because of this."

The adjustable features both physically and in the software are amazing.

The long wire is also great because it never gets in the way, making it feel wireless."
mokona madoki,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","I don't even remember how long it's been since I bought this, but I know it's been years. I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

Dave,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2024","My first impression is that this feels a lot more sturdy than my Red Dragon mouse. It's smooth and precise. The sniper button that slows the mouse down is great for fps, and the scroll wheel can be unlocked to spin very fast which is helpful for scrolling through long manuals. I also like the scroll wheel left and right functions. I'll see how it holds up over time."
June Oo,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",I tried this for about a few months like 6 months and the mouse has not disappointed me once. The weight helps my muscle which is nice and has the infinite scroll wheel. The sensor is great including the mouse. I prefer buying this if you’re a really good gamer.
ponybray,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2020","I have a medium-sized hand. Six and a half inches across.

Weight and Size
The G502 is one of the larger gaming mice available. However, I feel that a person with medium hands can definitely use it. In fact, I feel that a medium is best suited for this mouse. This is because of the perfect width of the mouse, and easy access to the scroll wheel features. The only downside is that I shift my hand to press the DPI button, which doesn’t impact my ingame performance at all. The thumb rest is really nice, so when I’m doing regular tasks that don’t require that much focus and precision, my hand is comfortably relaxed.

I would much rather use a lightweight mouse since I play shooters. Lighter mouses allow for faster flicks and swipes, and the G502 at 121 grams is a pretty beefy mouse.

With that being said, the G502 can definitely compete with the lightweight mice that people claim are so much better. I play 400 DPI and can easily compete with most of my friends, who use rather middle to low weight mice (like Deathadder and GPW)

Pros

Rubber grips feel nice, without being too obtrusive and becoming an oil/dust magnet

The cable is built like a tank. No scratches what so ever, and can easily support the weight of the mouse when you inevitably fling your mouse off your desk.

The infinite scroll wheel is perfect for avoiding Terms of Services and scrolling past a Twitter rant.

The groove on the left mouse click feels good, and I wish the right side was also the same.

Mouse clicks are very light and responsive

The number of buttons makes it a productivity machine

Thumbrest is supportive

The sensor is completely flawless, no odd tracking

You can flex on friends. Anymore to be said?

Cons

RGB is almost pointless since it’s covered up by your hand.

When pressing the side buttons hard and releasing abruptly it makes a “springy” sound (this won’t happen as long as you don’t aggressively mash your buttons)

The scroll wheel is pretty loud and harsh

When shaking back and forth, you can hear the scroll wheel rattle

The mouse feet are not the smoothest, and build up lots of impossible to wipe off dust

While the cable is sturdy, it’s not flexible and is super hard and heavy. It also gets in the way sometimes.

DPI button could be shifted back little

The optional weights are almost completely useless

Performance
The mouse was great to game with, but not perfect.

The responsiveness of the sensor was great, and contrary to popular belief, you can indeed play low sensitivity and still perform well.

The extra buttons freed up space on my keyboard so I could rebind keys to easier positions. The mouse clicks were very light, which I appreciate so I don’t break my joints pressing down on the buttons. The super tactile scroll wheel was great since it made scrolls more deliberate and accurate.

However, the cable sometimes got caught on other stuff since it kept flopping around, and I had to wipe my hands every now and then because the mouse can get hot (though I assume that’s a problem with every mouse). I have no idea why, but when I do make large sweeps, I carefully put it down, which I do because I fear that I’ll break the mouse. This usually isn’t a massive problem with lighter mice, since the you need to use less force to move the mouse.

Unlike others, I didn’t “accidentally” click the DPI switch buttons. I don’t think you will either, unless you’re fingers are literally flying across and you have terrible form.

FINAL VERDiCT
Don't buy the mouse just because people at TechRadar recommend it. For competitive low DPI FPS, just get a low weight mouse. Your experience will be much better. But if you are a high sensitivity player, go ahead and try it out. Amazon return policy is good so if you don't like it, just return."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024",great mouse for the price but its really touchy when using the scroll wheel sometimes just moving the mouse moves the scroll wheel on its own

Rollie,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","This mouse is very very comfortable. It fits my medium sized hand perfectly. The scroll wheel isn't the best, but it's very good for scrolling through social medias. The ergonomic design helps when you are at the setup for hours a day. The feet on the bottom could be better but they are easy to replace."

Tom,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2024","I have a Gen 1 from 2014 when they first released these and I've used it so much that friction wore through the slick plastic glide pads on the bottom of it. That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."
Julius,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024",I was having issues with the wireless version of this mouse glitching during use. I bought the wired version of the mouse and so far it is the best mouse I've used to date. Highly recommend the wired version. The wire itself is very non-intrusive. You don't even know it's there. Love this mouse.
theterminator27,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","I liked that this mouse didn't feel empty/hollow like a lot of other gaming mouses I have used, they even come with some weights to put in the mouse if you feel its too light which is nice.
My only tick with the mouse is that there are two modes for scrolling: one slow where there's a tick with each little up/down movement scrolling which is what I use and is fine then there is another mode where the scrolling wheel lets loose. The second mode is way too fast, you move a tiny bit of millimeters and the scroll on the screen goes crazy fast."

Rafael E. Morris,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2024","Go this and as advertised, this Mouse still rolls huge with the new Mice that are on the block. Only downfall for me was that they changed the cord, they used to be braided. Not complaining, I have no critters that get near my computer and if they do, they will get the zapper, lol.
You will also love the software with G-Hub, easy to use and program the heck out of your mouse. It will do everything except bring you beer and make you breakfast."

Big Daddy K,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2020","So, I'm finally retiring my Logitech G5. It lasted this long, so why not choose another popular Logitech mouse, right? Well, just the initial impression so far is not that great. Starting with, right out of the box, the gliding material was not attached to the mouse. The front pad was completely off, and the side and back surfaces were barely attached. I saw another review with a similar complaint. The first thing you want to do if you decide to buy this mouse is make sure those pads are in position and pressed down firmly to the mouse. It's apparently an issue.

Next, your thumb should be as long as Jimi Hendrix's thumb. The reach for the forward thumb button is pretty far. I have pretty large hands. XXL for gloves. That button is way to far forward.

Finally, compared to the G5...This thing feels really cheap. The buttons are super flimsy. The two main clicker buttons offer pretty much no resistance. I certainly can't rest the weight of my middle finger on it without clicking it. I don't know. I guess I'm old and don't know how these new mice are supposed to be, but I'm really tempted to return it or give it to the kid. Prime Day Sale made it fairly cheap. Had I paid full price, I would be returning it.

Otherwise, I may update later after I use it a bit more. No way it lasts as long as the old G5 though.

Update:

Okay, so I've spent a few hours with this thing, and a few too many visits to Reddit to figure out some issues. First, you need to download G Hub to run this mouse. Which is fine. The old Logitech software sucked...Hard. Although, I'm not sure yet that GHub is too much better. First, it wants to do a firmware update. So you accpet that and start the update, and it will sit there to the end of time saying don't uplug the mouse, it is updating the frimware. If you don't see a progress bar after you start the update, you pretty much need to unplug the mouse and plug it back in. That will immediately trigger the updater to kick off and it will update the software.

Next, you have two color zones you can adjust, and a page dedicated to do so. You can have the logo and the DPI lights do two different color displays. When you configure that, it shows what your mouse should be doing. Yet, it won't be doing it. For some reason, the DPI lights are not set to be on all the time by default. So even though your picking colors and changing display types, it sits there... dark. The best part is, there is a place to set the DPI lights to be on all the time... But they didn't put it on the page where you manage the lights. Instead you have to click on the main ""Settings"" gear icon, and then you can select to have those lights on all the time. I wonder how many mice get returned as defective for this. Seems like if your going to have two customizable lighting zones, you would set the software to have those lights on all the time out of the box. Dumb dumb dumb.

I will retract my comment about the forward button on the thumb. That is apparenetly a DPI shift to let you quickly and temporarily change DPI. That isn't that important for my puposes, so that button doesn't matter so much. With that default function, probably best to have it out of the way. As for the actually DPI adjustments, took me a bit to find them frankly. They are contoured into the side by the index finger, they are both glossy and smooth, and by the time you figure out you are touching it, it is clicked and the DPI is changing. I will get used to it, but again, some resistance and tactile sensation would be nice. Glossy and smooth buttons are not great, and I keep accidentally dropping my DPI with that button location, and the fact it is so easily pushed. Frankly, I liked how the G5 had the DPI adjustment behind the wheel, but this one has other stuff there which I will probably never use.

The center wheel. Nice that you can have it smooth or notchy. Notches are a bit aggressive, but maybe that smooths out. Wouldn't mind if the wheel had some texture. Maybe I'm the only one with calouses in this world? Very hard to feel it, especially when it is set to freewheel. There are slits cut across it, but most of the surface you are touching is smooth.

Long story short, with the software flaws, the loose gliding material, and the smooth buttons, I'm leaving it at a 3 stars. I will say, I do enjoy the stock weight though. It has extra weights, but it is right on for me weight wise out of the box. And even though I had to adjust the gliding surfaces myself, it does move well. I like that they softened up the cable from the G5 as well. Still braided, but way more flexible. Hopefully it holds up as well."

KC,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024","The mouse wheel isn't rubberized. I checked and all my mice - from a stock dell mouse to a cheap-o retractable mouse to my oldest mouse - all had rubberized wheels.. The no-grip wheel on this mouse might be ok, except *you have to use a bit of force to spin it so your finger can slip*.

The mouse wheel doesn't spin naturally either. It feels stiff and loose at the same time. I tried in free-spin mode and it still feels wrong.

The other complaint I have is that it's hard to make sense of which profile your on and what DPI setting and polling rate that is. It's too much which makes it confusing. If the indicator lights were setup a little differently, it'd probably be a lot better.

Then there's one minor complaint that it's a little too heavy. All good tools have a little heft, it helps with control - but the weight on this mouse is is silly. I love that it has weights to add, but surprisingly you'd want to remove a few grams, not add any more.

Everything else is spot on.. The thumb notch is great. The side grips are great. The cord is nice and loose and lightweight, the skates are great too. The hump is great for palm or claw.

I would be able to figure out the profile / DPI lights after a while, and I like the weight well enough - its that DANG MOUSE WHEEL that ruined it for me.."
