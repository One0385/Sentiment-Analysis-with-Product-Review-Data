Sean,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2021","I bought this mouse on sale to replace my original G502 that I had for many, many years. My previous one had the pads wear off and the M1 eventually stopped being reliable.

This one worked well for a few months, but now it's started up with an issue where M1 will not remain held. This means you can't drag the mouse to drag files or drag to select multiple files. Sometimes it'll register holding the mouse button as a bunch of clicks, which means it'll do all sorts of crazy unexpected things during normal use. This also means it's pretty much worthless for gaming, which is the primary purpose I purchased this for, but also pretty much any other regular use (I work from home, so this has caused me headaches for work, too). This is apparently a long standing issue that I found all over google, as well as some recent reviews, however it doesn't appear to be something Logitech has resolved at this point and time. I cannot recommend this mouse at all, as the likelihood of experiencing this appears to be pretty high with this model. It's a shame because the G502 is one of the best peripherals I've ever used in my decades of PC use and gaming, but it appears the quality of the device is no longer reliable."
SpyderMonkey,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2023","Not sure how well this mouse works. Never got past the GHub software installation. Hangs. Typical with Logitech from my experience. I did try many different ways and instructions. Should not be that hard. They should team up with Adobe...enough destruction in installations to strip the planet bare of any living thing....sorry...a little frustrated after an hour trying to make this stupid mouse work.
The middle scroll button is also wonky. The non click is too slippery. The click is too hard.

I ended up buying the Corsair M65 RGB Elite mouse. Much better! Better feel. Better buttons. Just better in all ways. No issues with software install. However, why a mouse install program should be 1.0 Gb is beyond me. It seems like just sneezing costs you 500 Mb..."
Geocentricity,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2020","Great ergo and button placement, nothing to complain about when it was brand new. Then the left-click started acting up just 4 months into ownership. The left-click sometimes produced double-clicks and click-hold operations would drop the hold operation sporatically, which means the mouse became useless for both gaming AND WFH uses. Contacted support and was barraged with useless troubleshooting issues and they have the ""expertise"" to send me to a third party website to test for double-clicks. Seriously? Treating customers as though they were lying is a slap to the face. AND they wanted me to video record myself while I performed the test with other info written so it is visible in the video at the same time. WTF is this, Reddit verification for /r/realgirls?

The problem is clear - the switch is faulty so just let me send it to you so YOU can test it and verify the problem in less than 5 clicks."
Colton T. Peterson,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2020","I have had 2 of these. Just broke down and bought a razer mouse due to the issues.
It will release when you hold the left click down. To the point where i cant move an item in my WOW bags without it dropping. Single clicks will sometimes double or triple click.

Overall, i absolutely hate this mouse and cant understand how Logitech would release such a disappointment. I have always really enjoyed their hardware. But do stay away from this mouse. If it only happened to one i had, sure, could be a one-off. But 2 different mice bought at different times from different locations. Nope, i recommend anything else."
Christopher Ramirez,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2021","About six months after purchasing, the mouse began to have issues with the left click button. Sometimes a single click will register as a double click, sometimes it won't click at all. Holding the left click button often fails, causing you to drop items with dragging and dropping in games. This seems to be a theme in other reviews here as well. I've been a Logitech user for well over a decade and they've done well in the past, but this mouse seems to be of a lower quality than their other items."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021","I bought the G502 SE Hero about 1 yr ago and it already broke, there is a double click hardware issue on the left button, making it impossible to highlight text or click and drag objects on the screen or basically do almost anything with the left button. Reached out to the manufacturer for the warranty, and still waiting for a replacement, it CS service has been slow and mediocre IMO. I use this mouse mainly for work so there was not heavy use on this."
Lawrence A Team,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022","Amazon states this G502 Hero mouse is compatible with MacBook but it is NOT. The mouse comes with an USB-A plug and no adapter to the necessary USB-C. MacBook Pro will only work with USB-C plugs.
Back it goes."
Enoch A. Smith,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2021","This mouse has a faulty left-click mechanism that wears out after a few months. For the price of this mouse, that should never be an issue.

The rapid-fire button is a little too far away for my taste, as well, and is awkward to actually use in a game.

It's too bad Logitech tarnished the good g502 name on this subpar mouse."
John Martin,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021","Barely used this and it's already having the notorious double-clicking issue, where every time you click the mouse (even once) it registers as a double click.

The Logitech website is utter trash and finding out how to do returns is horrible.

I recommend no one ever buy this mouse. Waste of 80$"
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2020",G hub is the absolute worst. Buy any other mouse. ANYTHING else. The mouse is just fine. But the software is god awful and lacks basic features. Upon every update they break more than they fix and add stupid crap nobody cares about. Avoid Logitech at all costs. Buy Corsair or something
April J,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020","My son initially loved this item until the left clicker broke off within 4 months. We read positive reviews and since it was so expensive, we thought it would last longer than this. As a result, we are very unhappy with this item."
meep,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2021",Yeah mine came with the sensor will just stop working every so often. And I didn't use if right away so I couldn't return it.
williams sarmiento,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020","En el título dice claramente que es la versión lightspeed, inalámbrica, pero llegó la versión con cable. Es una estafa. Amazon debería verificar que se vende lo que ofrecen"
P. J,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2021","Mouse click switches fail after less than1 year of use. If you can, find a mouse with optical switch sensors. Those last longer but are slightly more expensive."
Luke,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020",right click quit working after 2 months. loved it so i have to buy it again. hope i don't get unlucky again.
Jorge Serrato López,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021","Claramente dice Lightspeed y que es inalámbrico, pero envía una versión Hero y no es inalámbrico, esto es una estafa."
Michael,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2021",Already broken. Having issues with the spring inside. Won't be buying logitech anymore.
Damian,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2021",Viene con cable no es inalámbrico
Dante,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2023","My G502 Lightspeed wired/wireless mouse stopped holding the RMB(right mouse button) click in FPS and other games. It cycles on/off very fast when right button is pressed down. I googled this issue and there thousands of results and some pointing to that Logitech used inferior components when building them. The static builds up and causes cycling between on and off states of the switch when RMB is pressed down. One weird, but alas temporary solution is to blow air inside the mouse between the main body and the button. This is similar to when peeling a plastic sheet off a surface, it starts crackling with static electricity, but if you to spay it with water it neutralizes it. Same, but much smaller anti-static effect occurs when blowing inside the mouse.

So I have had a displeasure of contacting their support and after going through that infernal automated thing they called Logan - I waited 44 minutes before giving up on being connected to a chat support. However I received an email response from Belle M. who was willing to address the issue.

Troubleshooting suggestions consisted of some bizarre methods like using q-tips to clean the contacts - there is no way a q-tip can fit there. Forget that bunch of nonsense. There was another suggestion to update the G-Hub and Windows mouse drivers - surely it would fix a mechanical problem, not.

Still, going through those steps that I could it did not fix the problem. Finally received an email to fill out a form with personal details and attach Serial Number(SN) and the receipt, which I did.

28 minutes later I received a vague e-mail with denial:
""Thank you for submitting the information under case number 10809400 which we have thoroughly analyzed.
Unfortunately, we were not able to validate the receipt from the retailer. Without a valid itemized copy of your proof of purchase we cannot proceed with your claim and have no choice but to reject it. If you wish to provide a valid receipt/invoice as requested, we will reopen your claim.""

It's a copy of amazon's invoice and there is nothing else to it. I asked what itemized copy, but no more answers or communications came in. They are so quick and willing to take your money and sell their products, but when it comes to an issue - a bunch of BS is stuffed into emails and claim gets denied."
Heather,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2022",Absolute hot dog water of a mouse. You will get double click issue 99% of the times because logitech doesn't know how to quality control their products. I will never again use mouse made by logitech ever again. I would rather use mousepad than logitech mouse. Absolutely horrendous.
Devan Kennedy,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2021","I didn't realize returning was an option, I've had this mouse for a year but have had to use a macro to use a left click this whole time as it quit after a week. Got this for school so lack of funds hasn't allowed another purchase, but won't be wasting money on this again. I went years with cheap mice and they worked for YEARS without fail, finally spend money on a quality one and it's garbage in a week. Very disappointed, always liked logitech before this. The left click failing so soon seems to be a common problem with this one."
Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020","Mouse has been used for 5 months and is already falling apart. I never slam my mouse down or abuse my equipment, but there is something that rattles and moves inside the mouse with every movement. The left click has gone out completely and barely registers. I'm usually a big advocate of all logitech gear but I absolutely can't stand this mouse."
Barb Pettit,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","Skip this mouse and use something else. It was really nice while it worked; however, the wire failed in only 2 weeks of use. It's unfortunate because I want to like this mouse. I just can't forgive this lack of build quality."
Antares,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2020","Really wanted to love this mouse. ""Upgraded"" from the previous generation. However, within a month it started double clicking, or not registering clicks at all on the left side. This made it exceedingly difficult to game or even for productivity work. Very disappointed as I've used Logitech products for the last 6 years."
Alyson Beck,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2020","Mouse buttons break
Search online or on logitech forums, mouse commonly doesn't register clicks, registers too many with one click, doesn't register you holding down the button, etc. Tons of people with the issue. Is worthless to use for gaming, especially FPS, or even common tasks such as spreadsheets, etc."
JULIA LAPORTA,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020",I like the design of this mouse a lot however the left click gave out almost completely after less than six months of very light use. Logitech is slacking heavy here
Savannah,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2021",Bought this for my boyfriend last Christmas and it already stopped working. Wish I could return it. Don’t waste your money.
Joe,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020","Garbage mouse , most essential component for gaming aka the left click does not function properly. It will often not hold down properly. Waste of your time and life paying 89.99 for this garbage."
Dizzymillz,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020","First off, it feels cheaper. The click isn't right and the bearing in the wheel is not as smooth. Most importantly, it is IMPOSSIBLE to save a full profile to the mouse using the 'new amazing G hub software'. The very simple gaming software that worked perfectly before will not recognize this mouse. With Ghub you can make very nice, complex profiles, which I like. You can even run scripts with the mouse. Also awesome. HOWEVER. the basic functionality of saving the profile to the mouse (even very simple key assignments) is too much for this mouse. The two thumb buttons will not take custom mapping. I've tried this on windows and mac. Mac is even worse, it will just give you a message that your G502 is not connected and that's the end of it. So is the white accent cool? Absolutely. Would it be worth the extra $40 over the original? To the right person yes, IF IT ACTUALLY WORKED. Do yourself a solid, and just get the original G502."
Mark Nelson,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2022",Product arrived defective. Left mouse button would go off randomly intermittent. Cheap product
