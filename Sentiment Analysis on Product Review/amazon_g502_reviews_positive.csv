Craigc,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2024","This mouse has a great feel to it and it s very nice and smooth. I us my computer for work and am on it at least 10 hours/day. This is my second G502. I had the other one for about 3 or 4 years. It still works great, but kind of worn out from all the use. My old one had a nice cloth cord, this new one is thinner and just the normal plastic. Its fine, probably made it a bit less expensive than when I bought my first one. I am very very picky about my mouse and keyboard and my mouse has to have customizable buttons. I dont use all the available buttons on this, but I do like the ease to customize in the Ghub app and the extreme flexibility you have for customizations. A couple of buttons feel like they are in odd places or maybe not as quick to click, but you will get used to however you program it. The lighting effects are good, I just have mine set to a nice blue to see it better. I like the quick access button to change your scroll wheel to free rolling. And the additional left/right tilt buttons on the scroll wheel is another great feature. I have my tilt wheel set to zoom in or zoom out via the windows magnifyer. Very quick and handy to zoom in and look at details. Plus some cut and paste buttons and other things. Customization is great because you can assign pretty much anything to any button and includes the ctrl/alt or basically any keyboard button. I dont have the weights in mine, but those offer a great way to adjust to your preference. Great for normal use, CAD, and gaming. Great feel and great looking. I wont buy or use anything else until they stop making this model."
Subnet,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021","There is a ton to like about this mouse from how it fits into your hand, the grip, and the competitive edge for gaming you will begin to notice immediately!

1) Daily use
Not everything is about gaming, as this only takes up maybe 2-3 hours max of my time a day. The rest goes to programming, studying, etc. So, it is important for me that I have a mouse that I can use which is comfortable, useful, and fits my basic needs. Now, let's compare this to a normal run-of-the-mill mouse since this is probably the biggest competition. Why get this mouse Vs some other cheaper option? Well, for daily use I can list the following pros:
- Fits incredibly well around your hand
- Many different buttons that can be programmed for different use
> Shortcut keys, Forward/back from a page, etc.
- Great grip
- Change the DPI with different Profiles using Logitech Software

2) Gaming
When I am done working for the day, I simply press a button on the mouse and can quickly adjust from study mode to gaming mode. I even have the ability to change the LED lighting to provide verification that the Profile changed successfully. Following pros:
- You can change the DPI for each account, and each profile can have an option for many DPI's. The DPI is especially useful for getting the accuracy you need in a mouse. When studying, I can move the mouse very little and move from monitor to monitor (about 1700 DPI), for gaming, I can put the setting at a lower amount (About 800 DPI) and now my accuracy is much better!
- The buttons are programmable. This means that for every game you play you can set up the mouse buttons to however you want! Some of these buttons you want to remain the default, like the G9 which changes the profiles, it is up to you though on what you prefer! I personally like having important buttons be G8 and G9, then secondary buttons are the default forward/back. Then I use the target button your thumb rests on as a special (like a grenade wheel or something)
- The back-end functionality, such as response time will give you a competitive edge compared to a normal mouse. Now, is this going to be in the 1-3 second range, probably not? With gaming, how quickly your respond to something will play a huge effect on your success as a gamer! Simply being a bit faster means a huge difference between success and failure. (Think if you and the enemy both are competing against each other, who will win? The difference on who wins isn't based 100% on speed, but rather the better strategy, the more powerful weapon, and whoever is in a more superior advantage. Many times, 1-3 seconds makes absolutely no difference, and you simply make a rookie mistake, or the opponent has such a clear opening that you can just punish them for it. Once you make fewer mistakes though, and you become a better gamer, speed really begins to make a huge difference! Simply put, if you and your opponent both have equally great strategies, aren't making rookie mistakes, and know what you are more or less doing, you have both successfully accomplished the basic fundamentals, good for you two! Once you get past fundamentals, the biggest challenges now are getting into placement, having consistency, and being able to get to a location as fast as possible while competing with many others who are doing that exact same thing. If you are doing everything right, and there is a latency issue, then this alone can be the root issue of failure. Again though, not many strategies require a 100% speed advantage. I can think of cases where I have say a 2-3 second gap where the opponent would have to run through a hallway, which in this case having latency wouldn't affect my strategy as much. Now, if I am pushing aggressively, and failure literally means an opponent attacking me before I attack them, or get into a position to dodge damage, then latency is extremely important! So, this is where the competitive edge of this mouse really begins to show.

Overall, I am extremely happy with the quality of this mouse and will update in a few months after I have had some more time to break it in!

*** Update ***
The mouse is durable and has stood the test of time very well! The software setting up the mouse bindings has changed, so I am still getting used to that. Works very well in gaming, and enjoy the ability to transition from work 1,000 dpi and copy/paste, cut, etc., as bindings to gaming with 650 dpi jump, melee, etc.. Definitely good fit for someone with a big palm like myself."
David Britt,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2021","So, instead of writing a review shortly after I recieved the G502 Hero, I decided to wait until now so I could get acclimated to the mouse and keep an eye out for any potential flaws or issues with it.

First is the design:

The design, while unusual, works fairly well. I have small hands, but I'm able to reach AND use almost all the buttons. Due to the placement, I do have issues reaching the G7 button without adjusting my hand to press it. It may be possible to reach it with your thumb, but it's not easy to do. The middle mouse button (MMB) is somewhat hard to press for me, mainly due to the required pressure needed. It's considerably more difficult to press than any of the other buttons, even the other mousewheel buttons. Though, all of the button functions can be swapped and changed, so it's definitely possible to assign MMB to a better-positioned button (like the DPI Shift button). As for the DPI Shift button, it's a little bit forward-placed for someone with small hands, but still easily reachable. If you don't really change your DPI or need to change it on-the-fly, it's very useful as a G-Shift button or G3/MMB. The G8 button is much easier to reach than G7, but it's not very efficient for some games. In order to use it, you have to take your finger off LMB to press it, which leaves you temporarily unable to attack if you have LMB set to do that in whatever game you play. Though, it can be used well to take screenshots with, provided you have a macro set up for it.

Second is the software:

The Logitech G-Hub software does have problems, but it seems like those problems are at random and they don't affect everyone the same. Though, unlike Razer Synapse 3, it will open at startup without automatically opening a tab for you. It's pretty much in the background unless there's an update of some kind. One of the big advantages over Razer is that the macro setup is much easier, as it's very simple to create a macro (for anyone not familiar with it, a macro is a programmed sequence of buttons/keys that can be assigned to another button and activate when that button is pressed, like Alt+Tab but assigned to a mouse button). All of the buttons can be reassigned via G-Hub, and drag-and-drop is the easiest way to do it. G-Shift also works well, being the same thing as Hypershift, just rebranded. (G-Shift is a feature of G-Hub/the mouse, which allows access to secondary button functions as long as you have G-Shift assigned to a button you have to hold down) Unlike Razer, RGB lighting profiles aren't available unless you're using a profile assigned to a specific game or program, so that's a downside. Another downside is that G-Hub has issues scanning and recognizing games, as it only recognized some of my games, and then found a few more after a couple software updates. Though, if you want to, you can add the games yourself, as that will work almost as well.

Third is the delivery:

It didn't take long for it to get here, but that could be different in your area. I ordered it on a Friday and it came the following Tuesday, on the exact day it was supposed to arrive. Though, they will deliver it to your address specifically, as it seems PO box delivery is unavailable for this type of thing. As you can tell, it did arrive in perfect condition, though that may be because of the short delivery time.

If you're interested in the G502 Hero, I would suggest that you give it a try, as it seems to be a fantastic mouse for me so far. But, like I've mentioned, be aware of your hand size when buying this, as it may not fit your hands perfectly."
Garry C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2023","If you talk about this mouse, you really need to talk about the Logitech software, There are 3 different downloads at the Logitech website to change your 5 profile settings if you don't like the default settings on the G502. The one they will suggest first is G HUB and it is by far the worst and most convoluted to learn to setup and use. The second which they are phasing out is Logitech Gaming Software. (If you install both G HUB and Logitech Gaming Software, and you try to use Logitech Gaming Software, it will not allow you to use it, and it will tell you to use G HUB instead even though many FAQ's at the Logitech website still refer to Logitech Gaming Software.) However, the third, and the one you should download and use, is called Onboard Memory Manager. It is very simple and easy to figure out, does almost everything you want it to, and it doesn't also install a lot of other crap on your system.

NOTE: If you do wind up installing G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software, the setting DPI LIGHTING for ""ALWAYS ON"" is unchecked by default and is not in Onboard Memory Manager. (By default, when you change profiles, the side DPI lights on the G502 briefly go on and then go off to indicate what profile you are on.) I suspect this setting is unchecked by default for a reason, because I could not get it to work properly when set to ""ALWAYS ON"". When this option is checked the side DPI lights would not stay on the proper profile indicator to indicate the current profile setting, and they would randomly change (such as when I used the scroll wheel.) What I did was to keep this setting in G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software unchecked. Then in Onboard Memory Manager I would select a fixed color for each profile so I would always know what profile I was currently on. (BTW, this is similar to what is on the wireless G305 mouse but they are only small dots of color, you can't change the default colors, and they only select up to 5 different DPI settings on only one available onboard profile as opposed to the 5 profiles each with 5 DPI settings on the G502.)

Unless you have a desire to be frustrated, do yourself a favor and just download Onboard Memory Manager. On the G502, the only reason I can see for using G HUB or Logitech Gaming Software is if you want to change settings for mouse click one or two, which Onboard Memory Manager won't allow, or if you want to setup profiles for individual games and software on your computer, in which case I would lean in favor of Logitech Gaming Software which is much more intuitive and easy to use.

All that being said, once you get past setting the G502 up, the mouse performance is outstanding. I didn't add the weights since the mouse felt fine to me. And even though the highest default DPI setting is at 6400, you can set it all the way up to 25,600 if you wish. Also, I have small hands, and even though some of the buttons I will never be able to push without really reaching, it's very comfortable using for long periods of time, and for the current price you can't beat it."
Darth Chalupa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2024","This is a newer version of a ""classic"" design. I had it's ancestor years back(which only failed because because of an incident unrelated to use), and replaced it with this when I needed a new one. All settings can be adjusted with Logitech app, and it has onboard memory to save profiles if you decide to use it on another computer, or whatever. It's durable, and the clicks are satisfying. The only issue I had on my old one is the ""teflon""(?) slippy feet on the bottom. These eventually wore down, but only after a few years of heavy use. If you get to that point, you can just replace them with something similar, which is what I did.

The scroll wheel can by used in a standard ""clickly"" fashion which with the click of a button becomes free spinning. I didn't realize how much I used this feature until I had to use another mouse without it.

I play a lot of games on my PC, but I find this great for all uses. You can switch between profiles with a button click, and switch between DPI settings with another button. DPI settings can be set/adjusted in the app, so you can have a different profile for different applications or games. It also has a ""DPI Shift"" button which I find invaluable. It's a thumb button which when held ""shifts"" the DPI to whatever setting you have it set too. It can be for anything, but it's great for shooters. I have it set to a low DPI, so when I press the button it instantly drop down the DPI which makes sniping an precision aiming MUCH easier. Then you just release it and your DPI is back to normal. I use this all the time on a variety of games.

It comes with a set of weights that you can install on the bottom of the mouse with a magnetic lid. You can use as little or as many as you want. I've used all of them, because I like a heavy mouse.

And of course it has RGB which has many options you can play with in the app."
Popadopolas,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2024","Absolutely love this mouse. Fitment in my hand is great. The build quality feels very good and the weights you can add in make everything feel more premium than it already seems. The grips around the thumb/palm/to pinky finger are pretty sweet.

The mouse bottom glids very smoothly across my mousepad. I have a standard surface mouse pad, but I'm sure it could or would work with a glass pad or other materials.

Connectivity is great of course because it's wired lol, but I haven't had any weird connection issues.

The lighting is subtle, but I normally have that turned off. When I have it on it is bright and looks decent!

Overall this is a very reactive and precise mouse! Great for gaming or any task really.
Only thing I really wish was if there was a silent click version, but there are a few videos out there of people modding it to click more silent. I just deal with it haha, it isn't horrible either, but I prefer silent clicks."
Maciej Swieboda,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024","As an avid gamer always in pursuit of the perfect gaming gear, I recently added the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse to my setup, and I have been thoroughly impressed by its performance.

First and foremost, the design of this mouse is both sleek and ergonomic. It fits perfectly in my hand, providing a comfortable grip even during long gaming sessions. The customizable weight system allows me to adjust the mouse to my preferred feel, ensuring optimal precision and control.

But where the G502 HERO truly shines is in its performance. Equipped with Logitech's HERO sensor, this mouse delivers unrivaled accuracy and responsiveness. Whether I'm engaging in fast-paced FPS battles or executing precise maneuvers in strategy games, the G502 HERO never misses a beat.

One of the standout features of this mouse is its programmable buttons. With 11 customizable buttons, I can easily map my most-used commands and macros for quick access during gameplay. The onboard memory allows me to save multiple profiles, ensuring that my settings are always at my fingertips, no matter where I game.

The G502 HERO also boasts a customizable RGB lighting system, allowing me to personalize the look of my mouse to match my gaming setup. Whether I prefer a subtle glow or a vibrant light show, the options are virtually endless.

In terms of durability, the G502 HERO is built to last. The high-quality materials and construction ensure that this mouse can withstand the rigors of intense gaming sessions without skipping a beat. Plus, with Logitech's renowned build quality and reliability, I have full confidence that this mouse will serve me well for years to come.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the Logitech G502 HERO High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse. It combines comfort, performance, and customization in a way that elevates my gaming experience to new heights. Whether you're a casual gamer or a competitive esports enthusiast, I highly recommend giving the G502 HERO a try."
tim dunn,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024","Then again, I've never tested if sn*t is slippery, and I'm not about to.

The glides on this mouse are magical. It's almost like the mouse is a hovercraft or something. On cloth, paper, marble (or did I take it for granite?) or my thigh, the mouse feels almost exactly the same when moving around (except for my thigh, because it keeps falling off the edge.)

The buttons respond with satisfying, authoritative clicks, like ASMR fuel. Aside from the mouse wheel scroll mode button, that is. That one simply engages or disengages a mechanism to press a breakaway against the scalloped mouse wheel. it's the one disappointment compared to Logi's excellent MX series, where switching from free-rolling to indexed-scrolling is some sort of internal electro-mechanical magic because the scroll mode button feels the same as any other secondary button.

Speaking of secondary buttons, the G502 Hero leaves me as sated as a diner after Thanksgiving. The thumb has three buttons along the side, above the excellent thumb rest. The index finger has two stacked next to the left mouse button. The middle has that aforementioned disappointing scroll mode button and a DPI button, right where you expect it to be.

Except all (besides the mechanical scroll mode button) buttons are reconfigurable. The instruction leaflet might have given a URL to download the config tool, but I missed it and had to search for it. The config tool itself has pluses and minuses:

It does not need to remain resident in memory. It writes your settings into on-board memory, so you can use it on another device if you wish. Think of it like Logi's Unify or LogiBolt dongles and peripherals: once you've paired your devices with a given dongle, you don't need to config tool anymore.

It allows for multiple profiles, though I haven't found a need for it. Perhaps prosumer-level gamers can use this? From what I understand, the profiles are also stored in on-board memory, given that one of the remappings for a button is ""Next Profile.""

I don't like unicorn v*mit, so I'm not going to talk about RGB, but just know that the config tool also controls that.

I do care about the pointing device's mass, and Logi has you covered. It comes with 5 weights that can be added around the sensor lens (even asymmetrically, for some reason) to give it a little more heft. YMMV, but I like to feel like the mouse is something tangible, something solid, so I added them all. Plus, less stuff to lose.

The cord is thin (not braided) and long. It's very flexible, adding no resistance when moving the mouse. The thumb rest is a welcome addition, and there is a large dead area (read: no buttons) to rest my thumb against the side of the pointing device without triggering something.

It might not do everything a $100+ mouse does, but what it does, it does WELL."
Jeff B,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2024","It's rare I get excited about a new piece of technology. I'm not that guy. But I spend all day on a computer and I LOVE this mouse! Just arrived yesterday, and I immediately downloaded the Logitech Onboard Memory Manager to program the mouse settings and started experimenting. I thought having so many buttons would be confusing, but they have very logical uses for them (and of course they can be customized). Fits my hand great, and I love the free-spinning wheel and tilt/side scrolling.

I've learned that a mouse's dpi can be measured by changing pointer speed to the middle of the scale (or 10 out of 20 in the new menu) and turning off ""enhance pointer precision"" then drawing a line in Paint and seeing how many pixels when the mouse moves 1"". But also learned that most mice have a lower resolution sensor and multiply the output to get the movement people expect. You can see this with those same mouse settings in Paint by looking at the coordinates as you move around. Try to move it just one pixel and see what the smallest movement is. I bought two ""gaming mice"" for my sons and I believe they are actually 1500 dpi sensors, even though adjustable dpi goes much higher. My sons can tell they have much better resolution than their old generic mice. Yet this mouse is a full 17x better! I'll be recommending this mouse to a lot of people."
Will A,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","As an avid gamer who demands nothing but the best, I can confidently say that the G502 HERO is a game-changer in every sense of the word.

Ramesh,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2024","I’ve owned this mouse for more than one year, and for the price it is the best budget mouse you should get. They advertise the 25k dpi sensor tracking a lot but I don’t really see why it would be helpful in gaming since most gamers don’t go above 3200 dpi. The quality and grip of the mouse is better than other mouse’s its price. The textures on the side make it grippy, and it fits really well on to your hand (it is kind of big so small hands will not be able to use this) . The lighting is minimal and aesthetic. It looks premium too. The tracking on the mouse is great, because it’s been 1.5 years and I still get perfect shots in valiant. It also has cool features like weights which come in useful if you want your mouse heavier. The scroll wheel is also handy when scrolling through Reddit."
Austin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","One of the most popular gaming mice over the last decade, for good reason.

The G502 has 11 total buttons and 13 total inputs, all highly customizable in Logitech G Hub.
It has a very adjustable DPI (100 to 25.6k), with a dedicated DPI shift button, although that can be reconfigured if you'd like to use it for something else.
The entire body of the mouse is very solid and has adjustable weights. The body is made of matte plastic and rubber, and has an aluminum scroll wheel (with free scroll toggle).
The weight of the mouse is a bit heavier than most people would like for FPS games. I like slightly heavier mice anyway, despite using low sensitivity and DPI.
Every click from every button feels good, and sounds good, including the scrolling. Nothing feels cheap or poor quality.
The cable has no packaging kinks, because of the way the mouse was packaged. The cable is a very flexible rubber, and the USB A connector is very solid.
It's very comfortable to use, it has a thumb rest, the mouse is shaped in a way that allows your hand to rest in a natural position when using it.
It has very low tracking distance, which leaves you lifting the mouse less when repositioning.
The lighting/RGB is very modest, which I like, and it's also customizable in G Hub.

Overall, I love this mouse. I've had a few G502s over the years, and despite trying a new mouse occasionally, I always come back to it."

Gabe,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","I've honestly had a G502 for about 6 years now and it definitely is battle scarred but it still works like a charm. I've tried many other mice, especially ""gaming"" mice and none have come close to the G502 it's kind of a surprise it's this cheap despite being probably the best mouse I can ever recommend anyone get.

Onboard memory is critical, while this mouse is nice the software is pretty bad but thankfully you don't really need to worry about it because your mouse will remember all the settings without the slow software!

Flatwound,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024","I’m over 65, and my focus is not gaming at all. I just wanted a smooth gliding mouse, and heard this one worked on glass. At first I ordered the G502 wired “as renewed” for $34 but had to send it back without even trying it. Trust me, it looked like a flea market find. Now this one is brand new, I plugged it in and it feels just amazing! And on glass too lol! No pad at all, just my opaque green glass office desk. Right after this review I’m going to buy another for my work desktop machine. I don’t think I’ll even bother messing with the weights and lights, it’s fantastic as it is!"
Michael Schwebach,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","The perfect amount of buttons and easy DPI control paired with a nice software to configure it.

J. Claussen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2024","I haven't had good experience with logitech products before, but the number of programmable buttons and the shape enticed me to risk another disappointing product. Quite the opposite, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good mouse. The software to customize the mouse has questionable ui/ux, but it does work better than Red Dragon's. The buttons feel good to click, even the side buttons, and the shape is pretty comfortable for medium sized hands.

The only I have is how heavy the mouse is. This mouse without the weights is as heavy as other I have used with weights in."
Pedro Jimenez,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Honestly, given that it comes from a reliable company I can’t say I’m surprised it works so well.

Juan Diego Quintero Alvarez,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024","El Logitech G502 es el mejor ratón que puedes comprar si estás buscando uno con excelentes prestaciones, una ergonomía cómoda y un precio razonable. Es perfecto tanto para juegos como para trabajo. La cantidad de botones programables que posee te permite personalizar tu experiencia y hacer que el ratón se adapte cómodamente a tus necesidades. También quiero señalar que la rueda infinita es una función que realmente se agradece si tienes que leer documentos con frecuencia o simplemente para navegar por la web, ya que se siente cómoda y funcional. El uso de sus pesas te permite personalizar a un mas tu experiencia al hacerlo tan liviano o pesado como quieras. Los materiales aunque puede que retengan un poco las huellas y el sudor son de muy buena calidad y se siente perfecto o incluso mejor de lo que esperarías por el precio. Lo compré a través de Amazon en la tienda CE Store (SN Recorded) y debo decir que estoy muy satisfecho, ya que llegó antes de lo esperado y hasta ahora todo ha estado bien. La caja llegó un poco dañada, pero nada grave, seguramente debido al envío internacional."

Dean,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024",I needed to replace a couple of mouses that were flaky--one had jerky movement (like a bad wire maybe) and another the middle-button was double-clicking randomly (but too often). I like having lots of buttons (around 10 is my sweet spot--to hard to remember what I programmed then for if it's much more than that). The app is a little user-unfriendly compared to a couple others but it works. Only complaint is the body is a little narrow (had a Dragon that's wider and very comfy). I've always liked the Logitech Mice that I used for years (and a media keyboard that was getting a little shifty after 20+ years) but tried a couple on price. They worked fine but not as long. Hoping it hold up as well as they have in the past for me.

Customizable RGB Lighting: The LIGHTSYNC RGB technology adds a touch of flair to my setup. I can personalize the lighting to match my mood or sync it with other Logitech peripherals. Plus, the DPI indicator lights are a neat touch—they let me know which sensitivity setting I’m on.

I have moved with it (poorly packed) like 8 times. I've used it with all manner of different computers. I have dropped it. I have spilled food on it. I have spilled beverage on it. I guarantee that in my vintage electronics tinkering I have spilled cleaning, alcohol and all manner of dust and grime upon this mouse. I am a rhythm gamer and a musician, so the clicks on it have been positively abused beyond what you can imagine, and it still works. This mouse still functions as if it is completely brand new, with no issues and no inconsistencies whatsoever. The cord has held up amazing, the clicks still feel solid and satisfying, the tracking is still flawless, and the scroll wheel is still as smooth as butter. This mouse will live longer than me, I am certain, and will at least live far longer than the usb standard that it uses to connect. If you would like to never buy a mouse again, this is probably the one to get, as long as you are okay with it being wired, not wireless."

The cable is very good and flexible. Feels like little string. I was sceptical because cable is not braded and I thought it was about to be cut soon, but surprisingly it doesn't have single scratch after 4 months on very active using (almost 10 hours a day).
If you are competitive gamer this mouse my not be the best for you because of weight but i think 25600 DPI will pay that off.
I recommend this mouse for editors and programmers because of software. You can program all buttons as you want. Also scroll has some good features that might help you. It is Click-to-Click type scroll and also has Infinite scrolling.
Logitech's software is unlike others. It has game integration and RGB control is the best I have ever seen. (skip this part if you are not gamer). For example if I'm playing Counter Strike when I'm dead it changes to red. When I'm in lobby it changes to white. When I'm CT it becomes blue, and on T side its orange.

What I don't like is that the case of weights is wonky and cheap but its not a big deal.

The shipping was fast and good as usual. Nothing to say its amazon."

That took 10 years, but I did it. Don't get me wrong, the original still works great, but the worn out gliders make it so the mouse is jittery when trying to make fine movements. So I bought this one, and there's a few changes like a rubber insulation instead of the nylon from the first one. Lets just say that I can't even tell that I bought a new mouse. So I'm expecting another 10 years from this one too."

The logitech software to program it is straightforward enough and easy to use, wish more of their mice worked with it as it seems only the higher priced ones work with it. I thought the mouse would be a touch lighter while empty with that being the whole gimmick so if you want a super light mouse you might want something else but it's not heavy in any sense of the word. The weights come in a little case that makes them easy to keep track of and stored away when you aren't using them in the mouse. I see why everyone recommends it, it's a nice mouse."

The infinite scroll wheel is amazing, and changing your DPI is good not only for gaming but also for Photoshop. I changed the button near the mouse to T inorder to use it for push to talk, which leads me to its strongest selling point: the software. G HUB is simple and isn't as bloated as every other manufacturer's software. Everything is simple click and doesn't try to make you feel like you are driving a race car which seems to be a trend in a lot of gaming products."

BatteryKing,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2019","I am writing this after having the mouse a day and a half, so things may change. So far this mouse is working great for me both in Linux and Windows as I am using it through a KVM. My previous older gaming mouse had a few different limitations that really stuck out once I went up to higher resolution and could more consistently hold higher frame rates. Basically at the higher display capabilities my old mouse movements looks rather stuttery and jerky. This mouse has solved this with some rather quick and easy tuning. So for a run down on how this has improved over an older generation gaming mouse is:
1. Turned down mouse sensitivity in Windows, Linux, and in games. At the same time turned up DPI resolution on the mouse. The main thing you are really after is turning off ""mouse acceleration"". The difference in smoothness is night and day. I simply did not have the mouse resolution and responsiveness before, at least for first person shooters. With this mouse and a few quick tweaks I do.

2. Can run this mouse on smoother, very low static friction free surfaces. My older gaming mouse just did not have the sensor for this, so it would stick on the mouse pad a little and then the movement would be a little jerky as it transitioned to kinetic friction. This mouse can do it, so problem solved.

3. This mouse allows balancing with weights. I guesstimated where I thought I needed the weights and so far it is working out pretty nice. The previous gaming mouse had a wireless option with a battery in the back and especially with my big hands not making much contact with the back of the mouse, this would cause things to shift around and not track quite right.

For my recommendations to get the most out of Linux is to:
1. Setup under Windows. The mouse has a memory, so once it is setup under Windows, it is setup everywhere in terms of DPI settings and polling rate.

2. In Linux (I am doing this under Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with any distro) first order of business is to disable acceleration. Create the file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf
and enter in the following:
Section ""InputClass""
Identifier ""My Mouse""
Driver ""libinput""
MatchIsPointer ""yes""
Option ""AccelProfile"" ""flat""
Option ""AccelSpeed"" ""0""
EndSection

3. Restart your X server by logging out and back in.

4. Make mouse adjustments such as sensitivity levels in X windows and in games and enjoy! The main games to benefit from this are FPS (first person shooter) games. Other games any old mouse will do, but it wasn't those games that pushed you to get this mouse, right?

As a summary, even within a few hours of having this mouse I am finding that I am not getting nauseous as much with FPS gaming, movement looks a lot smoother, and I am quickly getting in a lot more shots and especially a lot more sniping head shots. Even in a window manager doing things like grabbing the edge of a window to move it around is a lot easier now.

While some may debate whether this mouse is as good as another mouse currently on the market, at least going from an older generation gaming mouse to this one is a big improvement. I suppose my only qualm so far is I fired up the utility in Windows to configure it where Linux is my primary OS. Also while some people say DPI does not matter, it seems like it helps when you turn off mouse acceleration and then use higher DPI resolutions to compensate along with a good polling rate. I would consider the result from this mouse once finding the right settings to be ""perfect tracking""."

Matter,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023","After my last mouse died after ~13 years (Etekcity), I decided to move up to a big-boy brand of mouse, and boy this Logitech doesn't disappoint. The mouse feels heavy and well built. Usually, as it pertains to electronics, weight has a direct correlation to quality, and this falls in line with that. The mouse comes with additional weights that tuck neatly under the mouse if you like even more added weight for greater precision. Once the weights are installed, they stay inside (even though the clasp *appears* chincy, it is not). The mouse has a great feel in my larger hands as well. It's smooth and the buttons are nice to use. The middle scrolling wheel has 2 modes (which DID take me a bit to discover.. that was annoying). The scroll wheel came in the un-locked position, which means the slightest little twitch of it would send me zooming down like 20 pages at a time in a word doc or online article. There is a button right below the scroll wheel that, when locked, locks the wheel into a single line of scroll; muuuuuch better. The next thing that annoyed me was where your thumb sits, by default, there is a DPI adjustment button. It's very easy to accidentally click this button which will make your mouse over-sensitive. The button also has a delay - so if you click it, it takes a few seconds for the DPI to change. Further frustrating was there were popups at the bottom-right of my screen that would CONSTANTLY alert me to DPI changes via the mouse button.
Soooo, this loops into my final point. Logitech G Hub software. This software will interface with most modern Logitech hardware; not only allowing you to make programming changes to every facet of the mouse (LED on/off, LED color/rotation, button programming, DPI presets for the mouse button, etc) -but it also keeps the firmware up to date as Logitech releases new. Ahh - so an upside here! Via the Logitech G Hub, I was able to not only disable that annoying pop-up window at the bottom right of my screen, but I was able to preset the DPI I wanted to use permanently *and* disable the button on the mouse that my thumb constantly accidentally clicks! Wow... a massive win here, Logitech!

I never get cramps while using this mouse either. It slides across my desk but also my ergonomic mouse pad with ease. The cable is a smooth rubber, so it won't get cause on your wooden desk or anything else you have that could potentially snag on other mouses."
