Jake,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024","Just upgraded to the G502X Plus Wireless from the previous G502 Hero (wired) because the original Hero had a braided cable and the newer versions dont, I figured I'd switch to the wireless version.

Overall, the G502X is quite a bit lighter, it's retained practically the same shape and functionality making it a nice transition from the G502 to the X. My main gripes are why have RGB that are never going to be seen and just drain the battery life faster (Which can be turned off at least, but you paid some $20 extra to have it so why not leave it on), in a spot you can't really see? At least the hero had the ""G"" logo light up, this one just has the strip that gets practically entirely hidden when you hold it.

The concern I have is that it was missing the sniper button out of the box, and while other reviewers show it has some sticker included, mine didn't. There is still a cutout in the box for where the second sniper button should be, and I've checked inside the mouse pocket (where you can store the USB) to ensure it's not there, and it's nowhere to be found. The package appeared to be factory sealed with all of the plastic still on the mouse itself so I doubt it was refurbished or pre-owned so it may not even be an amazon issue, but it's concerning when items listed on the website as ""included in package"" are not actually delivered. It's not a huge issue since I can rotate the sniper button 180 degrees to have it be less in the way, but I'd prefer to have had the secondary button as an option since I never used the sniper dpi on the original g502 hero.

Overall it's still maybe a bit pricey for what it is, the build quality is good and my original hero lasted for 4+ years with nothing wrong (other than it collecting a lot of dirt in the nooks and crannies) it was a good mouse and was due for an upgrade. I'm just a bit let down that logitech quality control didn't catch it this time and it arrived missing the extra button, especially on something marketed as a higher-end premium product for ~$150, I'd expect better.

Still, the mouse is good and I'd overall recommend it. I'm just giving it a 1/5 due to the quality control issue which while rare, is unfortunate. I'm not going to bother returning it just to get a new one to get a button since I've already been using it today without issue, just hope it doesn't happen to someone else who would really care more about it."
Nicholas H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2023","the size buttons on my mouse were starting to die and the left click was getting a little too mushy for my taste. Normally I replace mice sooner, but since I stopped playing games competitively, I let it go longer before replacing it. I usually trust Logitech to make great products and have good experience in the past with them. I wanted another lightweight wired mouse, so I choose the G502. Unfortunately this mouse was awful.

the mouse had a hard time tracking on my mouse pad. I thought it was because my pad was not perfectly even but no amount of fixing it made it work any better. it seemed to work fine one moment and the next it wouldn't track. I tried changing dpi, polling rate, etc. not change. I play a lot of FPS games and not being able to flick on to my target caused me to die more times then not.

The other major problem I had with the mouse was the scroll wheel. it had 0 resistance, no clicks, no feedback, nothing. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be a feature of this mouse. the problem with this is I found my character switching to my secondary weapon more often then I would like. one sec I had my assault rifle out the next I had a pistol or smoke grenade out and a few times I got stuck in the weapon switching animation and I died. it happened way too often.

one a final minor note, your supposed to be able to remove/change out the dpi switch on the side of the mouse, but I could not figure out how and there was noting in the instructions on how to do it. I tried to pry it off a couple times but it always felt like I was going to rip it off.

I was so scared after having these issues I was worried that this was the default style of mice from now on and all mice from Logitech were going to be the same, that I returned this and ended up getting a mouse from another brand."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024","Does not fit my hand compared to the old g502 hero model. If you have slightly bigger hands than most this mouse is no longer viable for usage like it used to be. Also the click strength for the buttons is about 2x3 harder with a loud loose spring sound that sounds like a wet noodle. This makes you have delayed shots in fps games. The rbg looks odd and the software for the rgb is a joke, the G logo doesn't even glow and no rgb for the dpi sensors. This was 2 steps back when it comes to a mouse upgrade. 0/10 This is the value of a 40$ mouse."
User,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022","In the 30 minutes that I have owned this mouse, 2 problems have already arisen. Things were working fine for about 5 minutes and at some point after plugging it in to charge it, the left click button began acting as the back button, which made doing anything nearly impossible. I talked with their live chat and the solution was to send it back after going through all of the trouble-shooting steps. I took it upon myself to mess around with it a bit more and it finally started recognizing the left mouse button again.

No more than 1 minute later, the cursor begins to fidget while dragging a window around and starts lagging for a few seconds before going back to normal. I have a G915 wireless keyboard as well which has been working flawlessly for a long time, so I know there's no sort of interference with other devices.

Extremely disappointed with how this thing turned out because I really wanted it to work and it feels ergonomic. My fear is that I get it to the point where it works fine and then starts randomly not working when I need it the most. Unfortunately this is going to be a return and I'll go back to my old wired mouse.

It is worth noting that if you are set on using this mouse, you pretty much have to use the on-board memory because the g-hub software is incredibly bad and your DPI settings won't be activated until the software loads on your PC. It actually blows my mind how logitech has completely ruined their lineup by suggesting everyone to use their awful g-hub software. I like my g915 keyboard, but I am forced to use g-hub just to be able to map the G keys."
BigBadJon,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2023","I really wanted to love this mouse, this is my 3rd g502 mouse and the rest have worked flawlessly. I saw the Millenium Falcon Edition and had to get it. Overall it tracks well, can't speak to the battery life as I have the mat that charges it. My biggest issue and probably the reason I won't use it anymore (making it the most expensive paper weight ever) is the mouse wheel is terribly inconsistent. It's almost like it's unbalanced as sometimes it will scroll up (or sometimes down) on it's own. Granted it's only in free spin mode but a mouse this expensive shouldn't just spin on it's own. None of my other mice did this.

It finally annoyed me enough to submit a warranty claim. They wanted me to upload a complicated video where I demonstrate the issue (which is inconsistent) and have my ticket number hand drawn on a piece of paper, then pull the puck off the bottom to show the serial number. Hadn't had a manufacturer ever ask for something like that. It's kinda hard to demonstrate but it also fell to the bottom of my busy list, I finally sat down to try again and after only 3 days they closed my ticket. Worst customer service I've had in a while."
Tamika Cole,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2024","Needed a new mouse for gaming as My current mouse is a couple years old and the clickers are starting to go. Decided to spend a little more than previously and even though this logitech didn't have a braided cord (odd for a mouse at this price point) I decided to try it out.

First Impression was that it was abnormally light. It did fit my hand well (longer hand) and it was hard to dial in the dpi to what I like on my mouse, the software was clunky and a bit hard to follow. But new mouse, lets learn how to use it! Then It happened, the mouse cursor started jumping instead of moving smoothly, THEN both mouth buttons stopped working. Nothing I tried helped and as I was only a few hours in Its getting shipped back and now not looking at Logitechs at all. Buy at your own risk!"
Corey Chandler,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024","I loved this mouse when I first got it. I am glad I held off on writing a review. It stopped registering any clicks at all. Cord didn't get damaged, no debris, no water damage. Just stopped working mid use randomly. Looked online and apparently this isn't uncommon... yet they are still selling this (Logi and Amazon) I would love to get my money back but I the amount of time I would waste fighting for that is worth more than I paid. Tired of having to spend my time getting support for things I already spent money on. Unhappiest I have been in a while, to a point I may just cancel prime and everything."
Joshua A. Wynings,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024","This product requires the download of G Hub software to use the RGB, personalize dpi, and reprogram the buttons. Unfortunately, the software is a mess. The latest version has an error where it says it is not download, but it actually is. After 15 minutes of it ""retrying"", it finally downloads and installs. And DOES NOT RECOGNIZE the mouse. The mouse I'm using on the screen connected via USB is apparently not recognized by the own company's software.

I did a complete fresh reinstall of Windows 11 and still doesn't work. The device manager shows the mouse, by name, but G Hub does not. This is unacceptable for a $160 mouse.

Returning and getting a Razer. Maybe that will actually work. It's a shame too, cause the mouse is comfortable and I liked the Millennium Falcon design. Won't be buying Logitech again."
Kenton Baize,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023","The Design is a moderate improvement over the Gen1 (feels very light weight which use to set the gen 1 apart from the Razer Mice) but you cannot use Logitech Gaming Software with the Gen2 you have to use the absolute garbage G Hub.

I'll be seeking a return and looking for the Gen1 until I find an alternative because I absolutely refuse to continue using Logitech products that require the G Hub, it want's access to your Discord, it will send you notifications on DPI shifts, I wouldn't be surprised if it want's net access to change your mouse settings.

If Logitech doesn't ditch G HUB and go back to the Logitech Gaming Software they'll lose customers, like me who had been using their mice for the last 2 decades."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024",Mouse worked great until 15 days after the return period the left mouse button has collapsed and does not press down anymore. I use this mouse for about 10-12 hours or more a day for work/gaming. I was very impressed with the mouse until last night in the middle of playing Helldivers 2 the left click stopped working. The mouse was never tossed or slammed down and yet 552 hours of use later the button stops working. I feel as if the product was planned to fail after a certain amount of hours used. Logitech products are going down hill.
Eartist,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024","I bought it specifically for gaming; however, I realized that the ergonomic of the mouse isn't as good. It's huge for my hands, albeit lightweight.

The kicker comes from the expectation of a full refund. I was charged a restocking fee, even though I was told I would receive a full refund. Restocking fee is $12, for those wondering, so unless you're absolutely sure you'd like it or wouldn't mind the $12/$65, then yeah."
Juan A. Macias Martinez,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024",I just opened the box and realized this is yet another mouse for people with small hands. I don't have small hands. This is so annoying.
BBEBEBEBBOOOM,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2024","They changed the shape of this thing and it is terrible. There is barely enough room for your fingers to hit the left and right click. The hump on the right side is more pronounced and annoying. The scroll wheel is an absolute abomination. The scroll wheel feels like it will disintegrate if you press down on it. It has an extremely cheap feeling that is impossible to ignore.

The only improvement they made to this mouse is that it is noticeably lighter than the original g502."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024","Have been using the mouse now for a few months. The last few weeks it just loses connection to my pc and doesn't function properly at all. It works great when plugged in, but doesn't work at all wireless-ly. Do not buy."
Adam,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2024","This is a terrible quality mouse, especially compared to my old G502 which sadly stopped working after 4 years. This one stopped working after only four months with my bottom, sun button, refusing to work now. And then when trying to contact customer service, all you get is useless and helpless AI chat bots. I’m very frustrated that the mouse is such a bad quality and stopped working. TERRIBLE customer service. Stay away by all means."
Nameless,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2023","I bought this mouse due to the extremely positive reviews I keep hearing about it. I purchased the wireless non-rgb version mainly for games and custom shortcuts in Blender. However, the software you have to use in order to program and use the custom buttons keeps saying the mouse is inactive even though all normal default functionality of the mouse is still working. It's just the custom buttons I have set up that no longer work unless the software is running and can find your mouse.

I'm using this with an HP Omen gaming laptop with Windows 11. If I can get a solid fix for this then I will change my review. However, buying a programmable mouse for this price and can't use the programmable buttons is unacceptable. I've already uninstalled and re-installed GHub as well as unplugging my mouse and restarting my computer several times. It will work briefly each time, but then the software will go back to saying the mouse is inactive -- which then I can't use my custom setup."
Brian P,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2024","Bought a new product. Nothing on the package indicated it was refurbished until I registered the product on Logitech’s site.

Amazon is shipping a new one, however, I encourage everyone to check the device registration details to make sure you didn’t pay full price for refurbished items with less warranty support."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024","The case is not tightly bound, And it makes noise while playing, i think i am going to get back to my old mouse and throw this in to the garbage can, this was one of my beloved series, how did they screw it's built quality is beyond me."
Bramwell,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","This mouse has the worst middle mouse button I've ever used
First mode: Loud ratcheting scroll that doesn't glide at all when more force is applied, just rough manual scrolling.
Second mode: Freely glides but as soon as you take your finger off the scroll wheel it will continue to move the page around as it settles. It has zero resistance and feels sloppy and unusable.
Definitely a step down from previous Logitech scroll wheels. I wish this thing had the MX Master 3S wheel"
Austin T.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023","The amount of times I have accidentally hit some button that changed the profile and made all my buttons stop working is numerous. The wheel has a togglable click setting which I found much later during my ownership, however the click less setting for the wheel is so awful for web pages and anything where any degree of accuracy is needed. It has awkward button placement every where. I'm not sure if i want to try and resell the mouse for 50$ or stomp it in to plastic bits for my own satisfaction."
RPM,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2023","This is the 2nd G502 Ive purchased. The first wasn't the ""X"" version and worked well for years. This model broke with mild use after 4 months. The side ""G4"" button literally snapped off when being pressed. For a premier gaming mouse that cost north of $100 when I got it, it is pretty cheap garbage. I don't expect mice to last forever but my first thought when unboxing it was ""Wow, this thing is light and really fragile feeling."" Well it ended up being an accurate thought. I cant believe they sell this crap for such a mark up. But, then again, look who bought it twice? Id avoid an get something a bit more substantial.

Side note: Support chat (24/7) never responded so that tracks with the quality."
That Guy,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2023","This mouse is fine when wired into the computer with a USB cable. It's completely worthless when running wireless. It constantly lags, like it's buffering. The cursor EVENTUALLY moves, assuming you don't wiggle it trying to get a response. It happens once every 3-5 seconds, making the wireless mode (which is why I bought it), completely useless. If I wanted a wired mouse I would have bought a wired mouse. This is incredibly disappointing for a $150 mouse."
Ji Lim,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024","There was a small scratch on the button. Now I'm wondering if this is a new mouse or not :(

Mitch,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024","Had it for a bout a week before suddenly the ability to click was lost. The mouse still works to move the cursor, but after multiple resets, the ability to click is still gone and the logitech software doesn't even recognize the device. Besides that, this mouse has really ""pingy"" click noises that were pretty annoying and after some research it sounds like this current version has been cheaped out on."
JF,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024","Some genius thought to put the side buttons next to the thumb rest area, SO when you move your mouse you risk hitting the side buttons, after more then several months of use it still ruins your games"
Henrik DK,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023","The LGHub which is needed to support the special game functionality will not install on my Windows 11. No error message, no indication on why. After extensive search online and trying all the things I could find, I contacted Logitech. It has now been 22 days now. Received a couple of standard emails (try this...) which is no different than what I had found online, and told them I had already done. Last email was a week ago - I would be contacted ASAP.
I guess I am returning the mouse before my return window expires."
Stephen E,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023",The pictures lie. The mouse cord is not threaded. If you don’t like bearing mode of the scroll wheel where it just spins forever than the stiffer mode feels cheap and clicky. There is no light sync. Overall it seems the more expensive one is only expensive for the sensor and you’re better off getting the cheaper one. This whole Amazon thread is confusing with the photos and descriptions not changing depending on what mouse you choose. I feel scammed by this. I would not recommend this mouse.
"Not the product advertised, opened the box and there was a 5 dollar HyperX mouse inside, pretty big disappointment and I’ve gotta wait forever for a refund, just don’t buy from this vendor.",,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2024",Opens the box and found a 5$ hyperX mouse inside that was crusty and used.

M H.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2024",The mouse is pretty nice. Ergonomically it is only 3 stars. It is hard to click the extra buttons with medium size hands (approx 8.5 glove). I bought the mouse for gaming especially for the extra buttons and macro feature. The software has lots of issues.

M.Nels,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024",The mouse wheel is SUPER loud and clicky. Takes quite a bit of force to spin it. Returned.
Ryan K. Hamilton,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023","If you are buying this for gaming, be aware that you can't freely assign mouse buttons in-game. For example, there are buttons (G10, G11) that are by default mapped to DPI Up and DPI Down. There is no way to leave those unmapped so that in your game you can set them to game function. In a normal mouse you can go to your in-game software and choose to remap controls, and click the button you want to remap. This is not possible with this mouse. You have to use the G Hub software and create a game-specific profile, and assigning, for example, button G10 to the ""tab"" key (so you have to remember outside of your game what keyboard button you want mapped to which mouse button).

The mouse itself is nice, but the way they lock you into using their software for configuration makes me kind of hate using it."
Nick,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2024","The scroll mode toggle button and profile switching button (the two below the scroll wheel) were completely non-functional. Logitech has disappointed me more and more over time, with their products seeming to wear out faster the more recently I'd gotten them, but this is easily a new record. Well done, Logitech. What a garbage company."
Thiagarajan,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2023","I bought both G502X Plus and MX Master 3S and tested both.

Note: I'm not a gamer. I'm a programmer. If you are a gamer look elsewhere.

MX Master 3S looks perfect and performs much better than G502. G502 looks super cheap and the scroll wheel is flimsy. The side scroll is not available in G502. Except for RGB light, I did not like anything on G502.

If you are a programmer then buy MX Master 3S. It is excellent. Don't waste your time on this G502. I wish the MX Master 3S came with RGB lights."
The Beast but only one problem,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023",I liked this mouse a lot when it was working response time was legit. Mouse started having problems with the left click it would get stuck and not only that it started having stuttering issues ruining my online gameplay. I use the precision button to ads and for some reason it keeps typing the damn key. Pretty it’s really light but smh I’m filing for a warranty replacement will update after.
Justin D.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023","The first one I received didn’t turn on, charge, or get seen by my computer. Did all the normal stuff, different cables, different computers, just nothing.

Got a replacement, that one the right mouse button didn’t work. Again, uninstalled reinstalled software/drivers, ran SFC, tried another computer. Nothing would get the right click to do anything.

That being said, the mouse has a great feel and really satisfying click, lighting is really nice too. If it worked this would have been my new main.

TL:DR : two mice both broken, quality control is really bad. Buyer be warned you may not get a fully working mouse. Please try all buttons as soon as you receive it. Legit shame."

Namba,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2023","This version of the new 502X cancels the weight patch and most of the parts are made of plastic, so it is much lighter.

After three months of use, in freespin mode, when the finger is released from the scroll wheel, the scroll wheel will spin by itself under gravity at some angles due to weight distribution. After turning quickly, it can be clearly found that the axis of the roller is slightly offset. Very disappointed and had to go back to the old one."

Kirk,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023","Page says this thing is 4.6 inches wide would have been great for my large hands but it is definitely not even 3 inches wide, which means I have to send this back for false advertising. I spend too much time on a computer to be in discomfort over ill-fitting hardware peripherals."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2023","Scroll wheel is super loose after 2 weeks. Button placements do not feel good on the average hand. two left side buttons you need to bend your thumb all the way back to push them. normal gamer i do not abuse what i have and mouse died in 90 days. plugged in to multiple usb ports and also another pc and its completely dead, not working. dont waste your time with the Logitech G502 x"

Had this happen with my other logitech mouse."

Bernardo Valleramos III,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2023","I just got this G502X (White). I’m disappointed as to when I connect it to my macbook and turned on the mouse, the mouse didn’t have the RGB lights on. What’s more disappointing is it doesn't even work on my macbook. As you can see from the video. The mouse is fully charged by the way."
Joseph Dalessandro,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023","Well, after less then 24hr of use my Logitech G 502 X Plus has an issue with the right click. Google the problem and sure enough, this is a known issue with this model. I will be sending this back. Not spending this kind of money to have a mouse right out of the box with this type of issue. Logitech WTF!"
Nhu Nguyen,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2023","After three months, the device stopped functioning properly, even after updating all the drivers and software. Clicking issues occur where nothing works for a brief 15-40 seconds, and then it works again. This happens intermittently, and it is super annoying. Sorry if the video is blurry. I can't upload iPhone video so I went the video to a text message and re-upload it."
Samson,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2023","The RGB is default pink and light. If you exit the logi software, you lose the rainbow wave. Otherwise, it's an amazing mouse feel and response."

Hunter,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2023",Mouse one stoped working out of nowhere hasnt even been 6 months
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023",Right-click bounce back was very loud. Metallic bell ringing sound. Research found others had the same issue. The right edge has been redesigned over previous G502 models and bulged out where the finger rests making it very uncomfortable.
nn1kk3,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2023",Scroll back with the wheel does not work. Left click occasionally behaved like it continued to click. Back click was slow. I must return it.
CARTOONight,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2023",Left and right click are not dependable. First time start up neither worked. After troubleshooting they seemed to work for a few hours then back to not working. Never buying from Logitech again.
connie,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2023",I bought this mouse and had it for a month and honestly it worked really well until the left mouse click started getting stuck messing up my gaming performance. It lasted a month...
Russ,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023",Logitech has the worst customer service. I suggest you buy from a reputable brand.
david leifer,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","This product is trash, I bought it and the mouse 6 button broke in a week"
Antonio,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2023","Can’t fathom spending $160 for a mouse. It honestly felt cheap. Minimal lights. I absolutely hated the scroll wheel, on both settings."
T. M.,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2022","Imagine the original G502, but with left and right buttons that are not only louder, but stiffer, so much so that every time you click, you're reminded of how hollow the mouse really is. That's the G502 X."
Louis,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2022",Great mouse. But logitech g software sucks. So I won't recommend buying logitech products. Buy Razer instead. Razer Synapse 3 software is miles better.
bubbles,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2023","Cheap plastic, horrible construction, ultra light, and weak battery."
Diego,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2023",After 4 months of using the right and left click it stopped working.
Adam C,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2022",Says it comes with a microphone does not come with it. False advertising.
Brittany M,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2024","Based on my prior logitech peripherals, I assumed this had bluetooth and it's not easy to discern by the advertising that it does not.
Anyway, it's a bust for me almost entirely based on the fact that I cannot switch easily between my laptop and desktop. I even tried to sync my computers with synergy and purchased the software - my other mouse works fine (presumably because it's BT capable), but even wired on one and the dongle in the other, this mouse won't connect to both without manually swapping the connection.

What a silly thing to get rid of in a full size mouse. Absolutely not worth the effort and the mouse is only average at best anyway.

Will be returning."
Rudy,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2024",The top side button when mushy after a week of use and there was no response when pressing the button
Kevin Cinq-Mars,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024","It's significantly bulkier than the G502.
The buttons are mushy, and their different placement than the 502 is awkward.
The reversible thumb button pops off during normal use and is small enough that it might never be found if lost.
Except for its pointy front, the 502 was more or less perfect and its its cheaper. Go for the previous generation (G502, not the G502X) and save yourself some money."
Applejack,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","4 months old and goes from 100% battery to 3% charge in about 5 minutes. Cannot be used wireless at all anymore.

EDIT: Yeah, I have to buy a new mouse. This piece of trash disconnects and goes to sleep even WHILE PLUGGED DIRECTLY INTO THE COMPUTER AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN DURING ACTIVE USE. It will not wake up and be recognized by the system until I unplug it and plug it back in. I've never encountered a worse peripheral in my life. A complete waste of money. I've had better luck with $4.00 off-brand, disposable mice."
Brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","Despite what the literature from Logitech will say regarding compatibility with Mac's operating system, it is incompatible with the new line of MacBook pros from a hardware standpoint. This mouse lacks a Bluetooth connection, instead you have to use their proprietary dongle, which only plugs into a USB-A port. The new MacBook Pro line only has a slew of USB-C ports."
RubenFigueroa,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2024",No good
Chase Munson,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2023","They will lose your package before it even makes it to the shipper, tell you it was never going to make it to you, and think it's completely fine to make you wait (up to 14 days!) for a ""back end investigation"" to complete and not let you just refund the product. Their support will run you in circles and even stop sending the log to your email (when you've already typed it multiple times as well) and tell you you'll see a followup (you will not)."
HOWARD PRICE,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2023","after 2 months of using the mouse, the left and right click doesnt work. i wouldnt waste your money on this. it seems like this is a common issue for the mouse and logitech wont issue you a new one. apparently it overheats and stops those buttons from working."
John D. Morris,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2023","Claims 137 hours of battery life with all battery draining features disabled. In reality you get about 24 hours with a full charge. The gHub software is also extremely miserable to use and poorly coded, I wont buy logitech again.

Update - the mouse stopped working after 6 months of use. Does not show up in G hub or turn on at all any more. Spending 200$ on a mouse that is worse in every single way than a 20$ mouse from china was a mistake, do not purchase"
Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2022","The shape is not the same as the original g502! It's really a shame because the shape was the best part of the original. No other company has a mouse that skinny and tall.

Overpriced.

Feels cheap in the hand. (I bought the wired version)

Tech-wise it's fine, but so is virtually every other mouse you can buy these days."
Gradguy,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2023","I bought mine from Best Buy since it was the same price and I could get it immediately. The mouse itself is good but the software is junk. It keeps setting my default dpi / sensitivity on its own. I set it to 3350 but it goes back down automatically to a lower number with me doing absolutely nothing. I don't recommend this mouse until logitech can fix the software. It's been nothing but pain in the butt. (I also think if you can't get mouse software right, you shouldn't be in the business). I remember the dos 3.1 days when there was a mouse driver for the com port. It just worked. 100% of the time. As you can see, I'm very upset since this mouse is expensive. Logitech needs to fire it's software manager and get someone more competent."
Levan,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023","I can't believe I spent $150 for the mouse worth no more than $20! This thing is DOWNGRADE from original G502!!! The scrolling wheel...... OMG!! seems to me that they gave this mouse to some child to finish the scrolling wheel part. Unbelievably loud and clunky, randomly making very annoying sounds, feels loose etc. It's a complete disaster!!!! Plastic feels cheap and squeaks. Only positive side of this thing is that there is a lot of buttons which can be customized, G-Shift feature is just fantastic!! you can assign double amount of buttons to anything with help of this feature, I have assigned G-Shift function to ""sniper"" button. It's so sad that I can't get used to it because of the terrible scrolling wheel as I'm using it often.

Now, two options. First, get rid of this thing by selling it to someone with stronger nerves, and second is to disassemble and try to fix it somehow.

Obvious is that I will think twice next time buying something from Logitech."
