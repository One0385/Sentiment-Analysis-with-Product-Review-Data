**Rating: 5/5**"
Brady,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024","I’ve tried and returned many mice over the course of the past 2 weeks. This one is my favorite. The wireless is nice and I still like the ability to plug directly into my pc if needed. I haven’t noticed any delay or anything. However If you like rgb this mouse is probably not for you, with the Logitech logo being the only thing lit up, and adding anything else will cut the battery life in half.

This mouse is comfortable to use, the buttons are easy to use, but you also won’t accidentally press one in, potentially messing you up in a game. The scroll wheel has a free scroll mode which has no resistance and will just keep rolling, and a resistance mode where it is clicky. I like the option for both depending on what I’m using it for. I also like the weights and the ability to make the mouse slightly heavier or lighter.

The software is eh but not terrible. Navigation is simple with three menus, one for dpi, the second for button assignments, and the third for lighting.

Overall I like it, it’s the best of the 8 I’ve tried including products from SteelSeries, Corsair, ASUS, Roccat, and Razer. Logitech won in my opinion."
Joy Rodriguez,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2023","I love this mouse. Nuff said!

Pros:
1. This thing is crazy responsive and I really enjoy using it for gaming.
2. Fits my hand and I don't feel I have to claw or strain to reach the buttons with my fingers, everything is just where I need it when I have to press the buttons.
3. Works great even with some distance from the usb receiver. I sit about 8ft-10ft away from my big screen TV and this product is able to keep up with no delay even at that distance.
4. Battery life is very good, I use this mouse everyday and it can go almost a full 8-9 days without need for a recharge on constant use. I can even use it wired while it's recharging A+.
5. The software is very easy to use and configure, I also have a Logitech Keyboard and Headset and I can control/customize all of them from one central GHub app. it's great.

Cons: It can be a bit pricy to replace, especially if it ever gets Phantom Click where either it registers a double click or no clicks. I had one before where this happened. While Logitech is great as a company, they will have you try everything under the sun to fix the issue before they will offer to replace it under warranty."
Timothy J Stegner,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","Great mouse for gaming, charge it every week or 2, battery life is great, speed and comfort is also great. My old mouse died after 10 years and they do not make em anymore so I decided to try this one and it was a great buy."
Kyle,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","I had the wired version of this mouse and the braided cord was starting to fray, so I decided to try the wireless version since I liked the one I had. I love it and it worked out great for me. That said it does seem like Logitech products have gone downhill over the past few years and I have gotten some bad products (headphones) from them recently."
Alex,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2024","Fits pretty well in my hands, smooth experience on the computer, experience no delay. Works great out of the box."
JordanisLaureano,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024","I honestly gave the Master 3S a good try, stayed with it for over a few weeks but I just couldn't continue using it anymore I returned it because I was fed up, the main reason ironically is because of the scroll wheel!!? Does that make any sense? everyone on YouTube glorifies it, but guess what? I love the scroll wheel on the G502 series (if you know you know) The tactile feeling of the scroll (not infinite scroll) Is 100x better than what the Masters 3s have. The infinite scroll on the G502 (wired or wireless) is pretty much on part with the Masters 3s! (btw the side scrolling on the masters 3s is pretty gimmicky I mean it works but Its not infinite scroll smooth, its not tactile either just a regular a bit rough side scroller, I am tempted to make a YT video on this explaining in detail. But would have to buy the master 3s all over gain to compare them side by side.

Also, the G502 wired or wireless (which to my surprise feels the same on the hand regardless of the model) Is smaller than the Masters 3s easier to palm on your hand, more comforting. I also bought some grippy stickers for like 9$ bucks on amazon to supplement it. I love it, just wish the palm sticker was a bit bigger (awkward shape but its ok) Love the sticker itself and the grip it adds to the mount. Hope you found this review detailed for your liking :D"
Crazie Me,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024","My portable mouse died for my laptop, and I had to replace it. I spent the extra money on this one because I love the one I have on my desktop. I like the feeling of the clicks of the buttons, and that I can make the wheel free spinning or turn with clicks. I appreciate that I can control the mouse speed with a button rather than having to go into my Windows settings. While I don't really care about the colors, that feature is neat if I want to be matchy-matchy with my keyboard -- on my desktop, it all matches. But my laptop's keyboard is only blue, so I leave the mouse at its default). I haven't had to charge it since getting it and I've probably used it 24 hours at this point. It's better than my phone, that's for sure! I will buy it again if I ever lose it, or one of my kids ""borrows"" it. (Don't tell them that!)"
Just Josh,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2020","I was looking for a high DPI mouse to use with my work laptop to crate a full ""wireless"" desktop at home.

I've been using gaming mice for work for years as I can't stand mice with ""average"" DPI tracking speeds. I like my mice to be super sensitive so that I barely have to move my hand to move the mouse pointer across the whole desktop and even across multiple monitors.

Since I am using this with my work computer that I am not allowed to install random software on it was important to me that the mouse allowed the DPI speed setting to be changed with physical buttons on the mouse. Many gaming mice only allow you to adjust the DPI settings via the companion software which wasn't an option for me on my work computer. This mouse has buttons right on the side that let you adjust the DPI speed between several presets right out of the box, no software needed. You can use the software to further refine exactly what DPI each setting will switch to, but I just set the mouse on the maximum setting using the buttons so I don't care about tweaking it further with the software.

I also had tried a Bluetooth gaming mouse from Razer previously, but I found that for whatever reason the Bluetooth connection to Windows was not very reliable and I would often lose connectivity to the mouse. Using the Logitech USB receiver has been flawless and the mouse is just as responsive as my previous wired mice were. The receiver is a standard USB plug, so I'll probably have to get a USB C converter at some point when I get a new computer, but that's not a big deal.

On the bottom of the mouse there are two removable panels. Then circular panel reveals a storage area for the tiny USB receiver, and also has spots for two weights on the cover itself. The larger panel has spots for additional weights. I am using all of the included weights as I actually weighed my previous Logitech wired mouse with the weights I was used to and found that adding all of the weights that are included with this mouse make it the exact same weight as my previous wired mouse. I like the mouse to have some heft to it and adding all the weights gets me that. If you like a lighter mouse you can just leave the weights out or adjust them however you like.

Another interesting default setting on the mouse is that there is a small button that your thumb can press which will reduce the mouse DPI to the lowest setting while you hold the button down. This is particularly nice if you are like me and use the mouse on the highest setting as you can always push down this button if you need to do any very precise movements such as hovering over a very thin edge of a window to resize it or make minute adjustments when doing image editing, etc.

There are a few quirks which are a little annoying, but nothing that would make me want to stop using this mouse.

First, the mouse has colored LEDs inside of it as per all the usual gaming devices of today. By default the colors constantly cycle. You can use the Logitech software to setup the light patterns and lights however you like, but if you aren't using the software you are stuck with the default constant cycling. I even installed the software on my personal computer in the hope that any settings I made would be retained when I switched over to my work computer, but sadly the settings reset to the default after a short time if the mouse isn't connected to a computer with the software installed. So I just have to live with the color changing mouse... which isn't a big deal but I was hoping I might be able to get a little better battery life out of it if I turned off the lights.

The other quirk is the battery life. I definitely cannot get a full week of work out of this mouse without recharging it. Using Bluetooth would give much longer battery life but it's worth the trade off to me to have the reliable and fast connection using the Logitech wireless adapter. The mouse will show its current battery level via the DPI indicator lights when you first wake it up, and will flash a red light when it is getting low. It uses a braided USB cable for charging and also for connecting it to your computer in wired mode if you like. I've actually just setup the cable to a regular USB charger so whenever the mouse gets low I simply plug in the cable and continue to use it in wireless mode while it charges just from the power source. I leave the cable wrapped around the bottom of my monitor so it's easy to access if I happen to run out of battery power at a bad time, and the cable is long enough to basically just feel like I've switched back to a wired mouse temporarily while it's charging.

Overall I think this is the best wireless high DPI mouse you can find, especially if you want one that has all the DPI adjustments right on the mouse itself and doesn't require software."
Jonathan,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024","I used to use the Logitech G602, which was a beast. It lasted forever on a battery, was a great shape, and performed well in all my daily tasks and gaming. However, once it was discontinued, it became hard to find a replacement when mine broke in a backpack incident! I didn't want to spend the $150 or $200 you'd find it at online, so I searched for a decent replacement. After trying the Razer Basilisk and G305, I splurged on the G602, and it has been fantastic!

I was worried about having to charge it up with a usb cable, but that's something that seems to only need to be done once a month or so. It performs well, the battery life is great, and it seems to hold up well as a travel mouse as well. Honestly, no complaints at all. Maybe I should start stockpiling them just in case..."
Nate,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","Was in the market for a new mouse and stumbled upon this one. I was looking for something under $100 and this mouse fit everything I needed.
The battery life is long lasting and fast to charge.
The sleek black color and smoothness in your palm is out of this world. I use this for a multitude of different games from FPS to RPG and it’s been amazing so far and couldn’t ask for a better mouse. If this fits your budget I highly recommend getting this for Gaming."
David,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2024","Not nearly as heavy as many people say (just dont use the weights).
Size and shape fantastic. Very good accuracy and sensitivity.
So many buttons if you need them but you can also turn them off if you don't.
Scrolling wheel a little bit noisy but satisfying sound.
Good battery duration for all the features.
GHUB offers an insane amount of customization for the keys. From copying, pasting to opening programs and even instantly typing paragraphs with the press of a button.
Just outstanding 10/10."
Jeezus,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024",As perfect as my 502 hero wired. Only thing i dont like is no more metal infinity wheel 😔
Katie,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024","After repairing my G602 for the last year, I was strongly encouraged to upgrade to a current model. So happy I did just for the simple fact the lights on this G502 align with the lights on my G519 keyboard. Not ideal for work but a welcome distraction for when I need it. I thought I would miss the number of buttons on my G602 but realized I only needed 5 additional. The side to side push on the scroll wheel is great for backspace and delete."
George X,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","I have been using this mouse for over two years now. It's got the right combination of weight (adjustable), precision, and latency. I use it primarily for work but also do gaming. Battery life is usually good for 2-3 weeks of using the mouse 3-4 hours a day. Paired with the Logitech wireless keyboard, it helps me keep a wire-free desk."
Nick Haddad,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2024","A lot of ""reviews"" put this at ""upper mid range"" behind the Razer Viper V2. Let me tell you this, if you have ever used Razer's software, you know that is false. Logitech knows what they are doing with peripherals. Lightweight, fast, great battery life, 0 lag. You can't lose with this one"

Brandon,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024","Just waiting for it to go on sale so I can buy another couple to keep as backups. By far the most reliable, comfortable mouse I've owned."
Tim S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2024","This mouse is perfect especially when you pair it when the other Logitech products like the keyboard and mouse powerplay pad. The wheel clicking as you scroll take a little getting used to. You can turn it off, but then the wheel has way too much movement. But, it only took me about 15 minutes to get used to it after adjusting the DPI to the perfect speed for me. It's the perfect weight already but you can add the additional weight if you want. I didn't need it since I put the powerplay battery in it. My advice is get all of the Logitech items together and pair up them up using the software. It's great."

Yusnaan1838,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2024","I like this mouse. It works for my gaming while hanging out on the couch with my wife. The colors are nice when they work and don't seem to drain the battery too quickly. The only issue I have with this mouse if that the Logitech software used to program the lights and such is buggy and doesn't communicate with the mouse all the time. Seems to be a common problem with some of these gaming mice, as the old Roccat mouse I used to use had the same software issues. I would buy this mouse again."
David Swenson,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2020","Ergonomics:
Size wise I have medium hands for a man. I came from using a Razer Deathadder 2013 for the last 7 years and the fit and feel is very similar. I would say to best use the G502’s buttons I’m shifting my hold position up a little more on the mouse but ergonomically it feels just as good.

Latency:
Can’t tell the difference between a wired mouse. I’m using the highest report rate which uses the most battery but I’m okay with the trade off.

G HUB:
If you’re having problems you might be using it wrong. You don’t even need it on your computer after you set up the mouse profile (a tip later), or you can have it set up to not startup with the computer and leave it on there to tweak when you want. Best of both worlds. In G HUB you can program all the buttons, lighting effects and intensity (to save some battery life, I use 44%) and most importantly dpi, as well as the dpi shift speed which I really kind of love. Now there will be people out there saying “I transferred my profile onto the onboard memory, it’s not holding it right when I start up I have to open G HUB to get my mouse acting right DPI setting wise”. That’s all user error. In the program by default there are 3 DPI settings in white, which are meant to be what you adjust through with the dpi buttons up and down if you want that. Most people don’t want or need that and on startup it goes to the lowest setting. G HUB could make this more clear because I don’t know why you would want to shift through DPI so often anyways. Regardless delete the other two and leave a single white DPI setting and a yellow DPI shift setting. At startup of the mouse/computer your DPI will be as expected without having to open G HUB. What happens when you do it no longer goes to lowest DPI option but instead goes to the one it was set to. Copy profile over to onboard and never use the program again, delete it or leave it, disable auto startup so it doesn’t mess with PC performance. It’s up to you and I can’t fault this at all. It flat out works however you want it to.

Overall:
Happy to have made the switch to this mouse. I was torn between Razer and Logitech and you probably can’t go wrong with either but I have no experience with Razer wireless. A docking station that isn’t the PowerPlay mat would be nice though. Razer having that is nice from a desk/wire clutter standpoint and frankly the PowerPlay mat is too small. As an engineer that does 3D modeling and a PC gamer at night this mouse performs great."
A. Long,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023","So, I was about to give this mouse a 3/5, specifically for the wonky and irritating mouse wheel. But then I said, ""You had better know everything about this mouse before writing a review.""

The mouse wheel was just...weird. It was different than a mouse where you would expect it to have some detent to its scrolling. The wheel in the G502 was free! You could whip that sucker into a spin and it would stay spinning for half an hour. This was problematic for precise scrolling because it never stayed put. In my exploration of the mouse, I found this somewhat crunchy button right behind the scroll wheel. Didn't really bother to figure out what it did. I pressed it a couple times and told myself, ""I'll learn what that button does one day"".

Well, it's the scroll mode button for the wheel. Click it, the wheel is free. Click it again, the wheel has detents so you can scroll one line at a time. Lesson learned, read about what you buy! Now that I know about this, 5/5 mouse.

Not much to say about the other features. Logitech mice are just good. I like the button positioning, the precision of the optics, and battery life is decent for something that lights up.

Only thing that would detract points is that the charging port in the mouse is Mini-USB, and not USB-C. But hey, you and I still have a mess of Mini-USB cables shoved into your kitchen junk drawer."
Megen W,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","I've been using a Logitech G502 Proteus Core for a couple of years, and I've been wanting a wireless mouse for ages however, I had been hesitant to switch to anything else because I loved that G502 Proteus Core.

Then, this mouse came out. I knew it was time to upgrade. I get a mouse that looks, feels and performs identically to my Proteus Core. No, scratch that, BETTER than my Proteus Core. Except now no more wire wrangling. No more wire catching on the edge of a table or needing to tape it down. Except the sensor is faster and better than my G502PC, and the wireless mouse is somehow LIGHTER than the wired version. What kind of space age magic is this!?

When I got it at first, I was actually a little disappointed. I had been excited for this new, fancy mouse that was going to step my game up. But then I got it and it just felt exactly like my old one. It felt like nothing has changed. The wait to use it came to a somewhat anticlimactic end.

But then I thought about it and realized..... IT FEELS EXACTLY LIKE MY OLD ONE. I got literally exactly what I loved before, but this time with RGB lighting and no cord! What had I expected? I got literally exactly what I wanted, and it felt like home.

And the battery life, of my goodness, the battery life. I've been using this mouse since mid Early/mid-May. I probably use my mouse for about 1 to 4 hours a day, sometimes every other day depending on schedule. I charged this mouse to 100% on my first day of ownership. I haven't charged it since, and my battery currently reads 64%. Incredible. Over a month of regular and consistent use, with lighting on (at about 60-75% brightness, purple) and I haven't even gotten it to half charge. That tells me I've probably got another month or so of battery life to go!

I have been BEYOND satisfied with this mouse. I only had one minor hiccup. Initially I put the wireless receiver in the rear of the tower, straight into the motherboard's primary USB 3 port. Unfortunately, I noticed that I would get occasional stuttering and hitching with the mouse cursor. After a bit I noticed that it only happened when my cell phone was on my computer desk in front of my mousepad. I relocated the receiver to the USB3 slot on my Corsair K60 keyboard, problem solved. I haven't had one stutter or hitch since. I think my cell phone's WiFi signal was causing some form of interference. I could reproduce the problem with my cell phone location every time, so I'm confident in what the issue was.

BEYOND satisfied with this product. If you have ever used any of the Logitech G502 line - or mice of a similar shape - this product is an absolute NO BRAINER purchase."

Culbrelai,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023","I am a long time Logitech user for every mouse since I really started getting into computers many years ago. I was an owner of the legendary MX518, which lasted an extremely long time for a heavily used mouse (10 years or so) and since the G502 is the successor I gave it a shot and am not disappointed.

It has 9 buttons which makes it excellent for gaming, particularly FPS games where you can bind the usual things to the extra buttons such as throw grenade/change weapon and so on.

Some mice are so heavy they cause hand fatigue and pain with extended gaming sessions, with this mouse I have not noticed that at all, and I play computer games for long bursts of time, 5 hours, even 10 hours at maximum with no strain or pain. It also comes with different weights so you can change them out if you experience fatigue from the weight of the mouse, but I was fine with the default settings.

Certain mice, or rather the material they are made of, causes certain people to have their hands sweat when using it. I have had this occur with other mice, but not with this one (nor any other logitech mice I had mentioned using in the past)

Overall, it feels just as high quality and durable as the MX518, with modern touches."
theCavalier,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021","When the G903 came out, I was pretty stoked. Lots of new technology and promise all packed into one platform, and great reviews. It turns out that no matter how good a mouse is, one compromise can turn it into a nightmare. It also turns out that if you put switches into a mouse that quickly start double-firing is pretty bad too, but I digress. The compromise that ruined the G903 for me was making it ambidextrous. ""What?"" you say, ""that's not a bad thing!"" Well, I reply, take your hands, and lay them on a flat surface in front of you, and relax. What do you feel? Unless you are not built like most, you'll find that the weight of your hand rests more on one side of your palm; Left side for the left, and right side for the right. So, when you make a mouse ambidextrous, you make a mouse with a symmetric profile. It didn't take long before I realized that I wasn't going to be able to keep my hand on the mouse in a gaming hold for very long before cramps started in. It was like having someone twist my wrist. So, despite the great stuff they put into this thing, it would have been infinitely better to create a left and right handed version.

Enter the revamped G502! My corded version of this mouse is still in use in my household more than a decade after I first bought it, but I'm looking for a wireless mouse for reasons I need not go into. I can say now that they seem to have brought all the good stuff from the G903 to the G502 Hero Lightspeed. The wheel that used to bug me because it was so stiff on the first G502 now feels much more like the G903. It's even a bit easier to spin and side-click. The DPI buttons (which are still in an awkward place, which is why it's still just ""near perfection"") are no longer mushy, so that's a plus, and of course it's wireless, has the updated sensors, will work on my Lightspeed mat, and, just for the 'shiny' factor, had a full RGB logo. The parts that made this mouse the most popular gaming mouse (Logitech IMHO EVER made) are still there.

So, when, my gamer friends, you are trying to pick between the two, let me urge you to save yourself what may be a hundred dollar mistake, and pass the G903 over for the reliable old G502 form with the new G903 technology built in. You'll thank me later."

Robert Aguilar,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2023","This Logitech G502 makes for a great competitive mouse, in my opinion!!! For someone whose looking for there first mouse I would highly recommend this mouse.

1. It’s wireless and low latency. If you wish to play wired the option is always there aswell. Having the ability to choose between the two is a plus.

2. The software interface allows you to change every button on the mouse being able to change the G-Shift button, DPI UP, & DPI DOWN mouse buttons to any key you’d like to or and action. You can create profiles for certain games or keep them all the same to have have maximum control of your experience with this mouse

3. The aggressive looking mouse goes nice with any setup. This mouse has some RGB options but not like other mice that target that RGB look.

4. The weights that come with the product are nice for those who like heavier mice!!

Overall rating of the mouse 9/10 only because I don't have to much experience with other mice other than this one."

Wesley Allen,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2024","Set up was kind of a pain in the butt, you’re required to use a program to set up the keys for gaming in order for the mouse to really be used as intended.

However, wanted to set up the mouses, excellent way better than using a controller and way better than the other mouses that I’ve tried before!

Key clicks are very positive, and the options are endless for setting it up and the order that you want it. I will definitely be getting another one when this one dies."
Hozen,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022","This mouse is a solid upgrade over what I had used for daily use. I've had the Logitech G603 (very heavy, not many buttons) and the Razer Basilisk Hyperspeed Wireless (would cut in and out for no reason) and this G502 just takes the cake. I've been using this daily for quite awhile now and I can't find any down sides. The software makes everything configurable and the vast array of well placed buttons makes this mouse great for gaming as well as just day to day use. The rechargeable battery is a big plus (I'm so done with rechargeable AAs) and the battery life is better than expected. My only small gripe is with the software in that you have to upload your profile to the mouse if you don't want the weird dpi change on wake. Just an odd thing that, makes sense, but really should be better laid out in their software or maybe just done by default behind the scenes. Otherwise, this mouse fits my hand very well (I'm 6'1"" and fairly average) and has a thumb shelf which I very much prefer. Compared to the Razer, it looks similar of course, but the quality and use don't really compare. The razer would cut out at random times for no reason and that seems to be a well documented issue across many of their mice. As for a comparison between the G502 and G603, just spend the money on the G502... you won't regret it. The G603 is very very heavy and I am not someone who generally cares about a super light mouse. It's just a chonk. Plus, AA batteries vs the G502s internal rechargeable. My only wish is that their was a white version, but the black matches nicely with the rest of my peripherals."
Michael Chaloupka,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2023","I previously had the wired G502 mouse that finally died on me, so I decided to go all in on getting wireless peripherals. This works just as great as my wired version did, the fit and feel is perfect for my hands. The build quality is excellent. The battery is impressive, I only charged it once every couple weeks (that's partially due to me not playing as much games as I used to). Should you find the battery is dead, you can use it ""wired"" while it's charging just the same as any other wired only mouse.

Honestly I only have one complaint and that is that the charging port is micro USB instead of USB C. I think it's ridiculous to charge this much money and to be using such an old form factor and I hate that I have to keep one of these cables on hand for it. That said the cable that is provided is perfectly fine and I keep it caught at the edge of my desk so it's not laying on my desk and I can grab it to use when I do need to charge the mouse."

Adam M,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023","I absolutely love the G502. This is the 2nd I've purchased and been using these specifically for the last 4 years. In combination with the Powerplay, it charges itself perfectly and the play never stops. It is a bit on the heavy side, even without the added weights included in the accessories. The Lightspeed connection is absolutely perfect, have had zero issues with this mouse whatsoever. The only caveat is that these mice are susceptible to issues over long time use, just as any other mice. I replaced my original G502 because I was getting the double click issues, but it was also 3ish years old. Regardless, I would absolutely recommend this mouse to others."

hoof_hearted4,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023","No other mouse has this number of buttons exactly. Most have less, a few have more, but this has exactly the number I need. For Guild Wars 2 I use all 9 exactly. I used a Logitech G600 before this with all the buttons, but never had use for them all, and they havent updated that design with their new tech in a while. I had a wired version of this mouse, but was using a laptop to stream my gaming PC for a little bit, so I needed a wireless mouse. And have now replaced my wired mouse (will keep it as a spare). Only issue is that the charging port is tucked away, so if your USB cable has any sort of hood or thickness, it probably wont fit. Also, is should be USB-C at this point."

Long battery life and all the same functions as the wired version of this mouse. Literally what more could logitech do to improve. This is a top tier mouse in all respects. I also got it on sale.
BM,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2021","When my G700s started to randomly disconnect, I thought it was something with it being wireless, but when it continued that while plugged in, I knew I had to replace it. Battery life had always been an issue for me, but nothing beats a wireless mouse, so for a while, I got my on a standard M310, it was fine, but it lacked the comforts of the multiple buttons (which I actually use inside and outside of games) as well as easily tuning the DPI on the fly.

So I took a look around the market, I figured I would have to go back to a wired gaming mouse until I came across PowerPlay. Wireless changing while in use? Sign me up! Now I haven't bought the mouse pad yet, but with the current life I am getting out of my mouse, I'm wondering if I will even need to. This mouse is better than my old mouse in every way, it's so light it almost made me wonder if they had added some helium into it to make it lighter. It's battery life goes on for multiple days and all while having an RBG led on top of it. I don't know how Logitech pulled this off.

I will update this (or just review the Powerplay system on that purchase) if I decide to purchase the powerplay, but honestly, I expect this mouse to last me for years. The only issue (though not for me) is if you have large hands, it might be on the small side, but it's almost perfect sized for me if I rest my palm further back so I'm fine with it."

Kelli & Darin D,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2019","I bought this to replace my aging Logitech G700s mouse. I'm a developer and PC gamer so the mouse has to work well for both. I much prefer the button placement on this one, however, I do have a couple of complaints.

The wheel seems to be a bit of a step down. Overall, the mouse is very light, and the new wheel design is as well. Unfortunately, the detents for the wheel in ""click"" mode are nearly two to three times as strong as the G700s. I guess this is good for gaming where you need positive feedback of each wheel motion, but it's extremely jarring in everyday use. The amount of force required to move the wheel overcomes the lightness of the mouse resulting in mouse movements while trying to scroll. It's bad enough that I always switch back to free spin outside of games and even in games when accessing menus, reading screens, etc. I never had to do this with my G700s.

Second, the mouse is way too light for me. It's had to hold stationary for detailed work and requires that I ramp down the DPI quite often to help steady it. The mouse comes with interchangeable weights but these is a gotcha with this. If you use the mouse in conjunction with the Powerplay wireless charging pad, the wireless charging unit doesn't have spaces for the weights. They don't mention this anywhere, but it precludes you from installing the two largest weights that would normally go in the battery cover. I think the mouse would be fine for me if I could use those weights. This is a HUGE design oversight on Logitech's part.

Third, Logitech's G-Hub software is buggy and a major downgrade from the previous Gaming Software. Settings are frequently lost, particularly with the RGB sync between the pad and the mouse. There are times where G-Hub will stop recognizing the devices requiring a reboot. Logitech has never been known for quality software (Harmony, Gaming Software, drivers, etc.) but G-Hub is spectacularly bad.

Overall, I'm really pleased with it other than the above and coupled with the Powerplay pad, it's a fantastic addition to my system."

Isaac,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","I previously used the wired G502 for gaming, and i decided to upgrade to this one, I liked the feel of the G502 so i picked this over the Superlight. the battery is good and the adjustable weights are a nice addition( I don't use any but the option is nice). The mouse(without weights) is still somehow lighter than the wired g502(also without weights), 10/10 would recommend if you like the feeling of the G502, if you are looking for as light as possible maybe look elsewhere, its not that light, but its also not heavier than the wired 502.

The biggest issue for me is that the scroll wheel feels different than the wired g502, not worse, but i wasn't expecting this change when buying. When i first used the wireless, i immediately noticed that it felt different than the wired g502."
Kevin Conley,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","I have this mouse for gaming obviously but I also use it for work.

Nizel A.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2019","I was worried after experiencing the G Pro Wireless' double clicking, but so far after using the G502 for a few weeks I've not experienced the double clicking at all. I have run into another issue where the G502 misreads the battery and always displayed ""low battery."" This happened the entire first week so I let the battery fully die (so the battery's internal clock would ""reset"") and haven't had that issue since.

Manufacturer's packing is great. It comes with a premium braided USB cable, wireless receiver, and an hard shell case that holds the weights. I love the design of this mouse over the G Pro Wireless especially since I have big hands as well as use ""claw"" style so having a slightly bigger mouse that my hands can wrap around feels better. Since it is heavier it does move noticeably slower across surfaces than lighter mouses.

The 16K DPI Hero sensor is just superb and the extra battery life is tremendous. It can even be used on glass surfaces with no tracking issues. It even has a button for a scroll wheel mode (continuous scroll or standard click step up.) There is also textured grips on the side. My only gripes are that for the price it could use a bit more RGB and the 2 middle buttons are flimsy. The small G logos and battery indicator only lighting up is kind of disappointing. The G Hub software allows you to map any command to any button. There's a database of hundreds of commands to choose from including basic windows commands like copy/paste.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this mouse. Performance and ergonomic wise it doesn't get much better than this. The 5 minute charge giving it 2.5 hours is not only amazing, but a lifesaver for those that frequently forget to charge their mouse! If you're thinking about cutting the cord and getting rid of your wired mouse this would be the perfect replacement. Hopefully a revised G903 is coming down the pipeline as well."

Create With Cam,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023","I know, I know. The G502 has been out for quite some time already but is still one of the highest-rated gaming and productivity mice out there. But it would have been if Logitech had at least updated it to the modern USB-C standard. Having to use a Micro-USB when everything else on my desk runs or charges off of C is a bit of a letdown. But that's my only gripe.
The mouse itself feels great in my hand. Logitech has always been the leader when it comes to ergonomics, even with my larger hands. The buttons never feel too far away. The ""clicks"" are satisfying and the scroll is very smooth. I did all the included weights because the mouse was just way too lightweight for my liking, but was perfect after.
The software I think could do with a little refinement but isn't too difficult to figure out.
Overall I'm very happy with it and think it's a great value."

Buttons are firm but gentle, tracking is unbeatable and the battery life is enough to get me through each day without a midday too-off. The programmable buttons are sweet too, although I don’t use them as much as I had planned.

Joshua S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2019","I gotta say, this is just about the most brilliant mouse I've ever used. The wireless response time is astonishing. And it keeps its 1ms response time all the way up to 8 ft. (from what I tested at least - not to mention that it reaches all the way across your average large living room). I like how you can plug the Wi-Fi dongle onto the end of the USB cord to extend it to wherever the cord reaches to. The micro USB to USB cord used for charging it is very durable and extensive. Plus, it also let's you use the mouse in wired mode while charging. Apparently the mouse works with their wireless charging mouse pad, but I haven't bothered to get one, so I can't reassure that. The DPI adjustment is perfectly gradient allowing me to adjust the movement speed to a comfortable level on basically any surface (just don't try and use it on a blanket, it doesn't work...). I like the barring lock to the scroll wheel letting change the scroll functionality so I can flick the wheel and use it in smooth scrolling. Plus, the battery monitor built in is nice. The navigation buttons are an added bonus as well. I highly recommend for even professional graphic artists, as I myself use this mouse for graphic art and it's PERFECT for it. Apart from the custom lighting built in to the mouse, there is this awesome button for slowing the mouse down to a high-precision mode allowing me to easily make high density vertex edits on 3D graphic design (or for you to do whatever you wanna do with a slow mouse). Then my last fascination is the mini weights they give you so you can weigh down your mouse (which is a feature I actually quite adore). So... Yeah. Fantastic mouse. It's pretty cheap in price considering the features and whatnot. I recommend this mouse over all others."

I'd been using the wired version for a long time and wanted to upgrade to something easier to carry around since I walk around a lot at work as well. This has the classic ""infinity scroll"" button that's satisfying to use and makes scrolling quick and easy, and if you pair it with the desktop app you can customize pretty much everything about the way it functions. I have buttons set to work as copy and paste, back and forward browser buttons, and a control alt delete shortcut button for when excel gets too spicy for my bottom-tier office laptop and it locks up. I do also occasionally use this for gaming and it works very well, but I primarily bought it for office use and it's made life much easier for me. Battery life is solid too, I get about a month of use at 12 hours a day out of it, and when I do need to charge it I can still use it while it's plugged in (though full charging only takes an hour or so even if you're using it at the same time).

I liked the idea of supplying additional ""path through"" adapter, which connects to miniUSB charging cable and accepts wireless USB adapter, so you can connect supplied mini USB charging cable to computer and connect wireless receiver to that cable instead for reaching PC case each time... or, you can keep Wireless USB receiver connected to laptop and work with laptop in wireless mode and connect to desktop via cable and use it as wired mouse....

A. E. Bogdan,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2020","I was worried, spending so much for a mouse, that it wouldn't be that much better than my old G602 wireless, but the difference in responsiveness is impressive. Gaming is much more fun having it react so quickly and smoothly. Total win.

I personally lock down the speed of the mouse in the software while playing games, as with this one and my old mouse I would accidentally hit those speed shift buttons on top. Having only three extra buttons on the side is fine. Having 6 on the G602 ended up being overkill for me.

The heavy notch of the wheel doesn't bother me.

The G602 had some heft to it, and I thought I liked that weight until I started using this one. I even decided to leave the weights out. Its effortless to use in comparison.

I was also concerned I wouldn't like the ergonomics as much, as I really liked the feel of the G602. At first it did feel weird, but after a day of adjusting it just felt natural. As soon as I speed thinking about how it felt different and just started using it the mouse felt great to use.

I really liked rarely having too change batteries in the G602. I've owned this for only a week and have not had to charge it a second time yet. I'll post back if I find the more frequent recharge an issue, but yet so far it's been fine. Plus, it's nice knowing I can use the wireless charging pad in the future and never have to charge or change batteries.

So, yet so far I'm very happy with this replacement gaming mouse."
Alex Gonzalez,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2022","This mouse is amazing, has some different features than the wired one though that you will have you get used to. I used max weight on my wired mouse and it felt good, but the wireless mouse is actually much heavier than the wired due to the battery in the mouse. Once you get used to it, it'll feel like the wired one. There also is a weird button next to where your thumb goes, if you press it, it lowers your dpi by a huge amount(Supposed to be used for gaming if you want to be more precise with your aim). You can change the dpi in the logitech application. I tried turning off the use of the button, but somehow it won't turn off, but I might be doing something wrong, I don't know. Anyways, if you want a heavy duty, big mouse that feels good in the hands, then I highly recommend thing one."

Was hesitant with the Omron switch scandle but took the risk since all my other Logitech mice and keyboards have been 5/5 and their reputation for Customer Service + RMA is great. Using this mostly for productivity but some gaming as well. Using it mostly wired but wireless works well too - I don't notice any latency.

Great for anyone looking for a productivity mouse with free scroll + notched scroll with change button on top, horizontal click on the scroll wheel, ergonomic thumb rest, and if you'd use it the G Hub customization for all the extra buttons it is well done. Sensor is great - overkill dpi but loving it on my 1440p 27"" + laptop 2-screen setup. Sharp movement, good minimum lift height. Very, very happy I got this over an MX 3 or top-tier Basilisk.

Set up real nice and I love the colors as it blinks different colors. This arrived fast. Is why I love ordering from Amazon. Guess I can continue with the review. Logitech doesn't stand behind their product. It is not up to Amazon as they sell Logitech products. After a few days my G502 will not let me configure my mouse. My keyboard is a K350 Logitech. I wrote to Logitech and waited a few days for their reply. The lady had the wrong model no for my Logitech keyboard. They say you can have multiple devices up to 8 or 10 on same unifier. You read on other sites they say differently. You have to use the G Hub and unifier. My husband and I have been Logitech for years. Won't buy anything else. They do not stand by their products and use the Covid-19 as an excuse to take hours and days to help you. This is getting old. Maybe it is defective but if I send this back I do not have a mouse and I am on the computer a lot. As for performance I do love it but I cannot configure the mouse buttons.

George Vina,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2020","I have been a fan of Logitech computer accessories for years now and yet another product I buy that hasn't disappointed. The mouse I had prior to this was the Logitech G602 which was an absolute beast of a gaming mouse. It still works great to this day and is probably 4 years old now. I thought it was time for change and seeing it was the last of my computer accessories I hadn't upgraded I caved and bought a new mouse. The styling is modern and slick, the RGB is a nice touch and if you have other Logitech products and use the G Hub you can customize and synchronize the RGB across all your devices. With the G Hub you can also remap all the buttons on the mouse and even set buttons for specific games. The first thing I noticed when I took the mouse out of the box is that it felt very light but thankfully Logitech includes weights so you can set the mouse have the exact weight you want, I ended up putting all the weights in because it feels like it now weighs the same as my old G602 mouse. I cant comment on battery life now since its only been a week but seeing that its rechargeable and has an indicator on the left side, it will also glow red when its at 15% battery by default, so I don't foresee any issues with battery life. The ergonomics are great and feels like its the right size for a mouse. All in all so far I'm loving the mouse and definitely recommend it as a buy!"

Lance,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2021","As an unfortunate victim of two Razer mice (Razer Naga Trinity Gaming, Razer Deathadder) that had the MOUSE1 button (primary click) start double-clicking after than less a year each, I moved over to the wired Logitech G500. The G500 lasted about 2 years, which for the pricepoint, was fantastic to me compared to the 1 year lifespan of the pricier Razer mice that broke.

So, I got this mouse, the G502, since the Logitech 500 lifespan forced me out of Razer. So far the G502 has treated me really well with its functionality. The mouse software, G HUB, lets you set almost any Windows shortcuts per buttons, such as having 'Copy' (Ctrl + C) on your MOUSE4, and 'Paste' on your MOUSE5. Has good functionality across apps too, like Discord, where you can mute yourself at anytime with a button click.

For gaming it feels smooth, with adjustable DPI settings also at a button click (by default). I don't use the mouse weights at all just because... I don't really see the point for myself.

They all still work and the original wired version I purchased nearly a decade ago! My first light speed that I have was starting to have a bit of trouble on the right click (after thousands of hours of use) so I decided to buy a new one and keep this one as a spare in sticky situations. The battery lasts for roughly 30-40 hours of gameplay which last a month or so between charges and I’ve never once had it die on me, 24% is as low as it’s been… The mouse is crazy fast, I can’t tell a difference between wired and wireless response time and I’m an avid FPS gamer. The ergonomics are impeccable meaning this mouse never feels uncomfortable in my hand and I have large hands as I’m 6’4”. Free yourself of cord snags and get one of these mice today, it feels so smooth and free when you use it."
Ryan H,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023","I like the mouse, has a nice weight to it. Loud click. But the instructions that come with it, are just super basic pics, with no words. I know how to plug a mouse in to the computer, but I've never had a mouse that comes with weights (it comes with weights and a cool little case for them, btw), I've figured out where to put the little weights in, but not the larger ones."

john stiger,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2023","I bought this mouse to replace a Razor Mamba which was the worst mouse I've ever used.
The difference in quality is insane. I went from a mouse that was unusable on mac, and poorly performant on Windows, to a mouse that couldn't perform better.
The customizable weights, the scroll wheel, the position, and function of the buttons, are all perfect.
It sits next to, and holds it's own with a Swiftpoint Z gaming mouse that cost more than twice as much.
I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
Antonio,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023","The Logitech G502 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse with Hero sensor is an excellent choice for gamers who want a high-performance mouse with wireless connectivity. The Hero sensor delivers exceptional accuracy and precision, making it a great choice for first-person shooter games and other fast-paced genres. The wireless connectivity is also top-notch, with a range of up to 60 feet and a lightning-fast 1ms report rate.

One of the standout features of the G502 is its customizable weights, which allow you to fine-tune the feel of the mouse to your preference. The mouse also has 11 programmable buttons, including a scroll wheel that can switch between hyper-fast and ratcheted scrolling.

Overall, the Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a top-of-the-line gaming mouse that delivers on both performance and wireless connectivity. It's well worth the investment for serious gamers."
Matt,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2022","I've only had this mouse for about a month, but I really like it. I'm a guy who gets really frustrated you can feel the delay between moving a mouse and seeing it move on the screen. With this, it seems instant. I like a mouse with a bit of weight, so I added all of them. Also looks cool and feels solid.

No batteries to replace either - just plug it in every few days to ensure it's charged. G-Suite software is easy enough to configure to tweak the purpose of the buttons. I think you can do it at the game/app level too, but I haven't messed with that.

Only gripe is that you have to use Logitech's proprietary wireless charger. I've got a number of wireless chargers I wish I could use, but to no avail. Maybe one day someone will reverse engineer it and we can make a DIY one or something."
hansmuff,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020","I have used a lot of PC peripherals, and mice, in my geek life.
This one is just stunning to me. I can't find a single issue with it.

Here is what I like:
- Ultra-fast response, there is zero difference to a wired mouse
- Fantastic shape, fits my hands really well and I can reach all the buttons without strain or moving the mouse
- The number of buttons is fantastic, and the software to program them works well
- Weight is good, I don't like heavy mice for gaming. This is no MX Master (awesome for work, terrible for games)
- The ""snipe"" button that sets the DPI to a custom (NOT a fixed) value is WONDERFUL in games

Here's what I don't like:
-----

I can't find any fault with this mouse. The price is steep, but you get a super high performance product, not something that's just OK with one great feature. No, this thing is perfect, at least to me.

I didn't receive this mouse for free, and this isn't a paid review. I paid full retail price out of pocket, and I don't regret it. I think that if you don't mind the price, you will not find any better, unless the shape doesn't fit your hands, that's always a possibility."
R. Allen,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023","My mouse started being jumpy, and I decided it was time for a new one. After looking at the choices, since I always stick with Logitech, I decided on the G502. It isn't a cheap option, but it has a nice feel. I added a couple of the included weights and adjusted the dpi on it. It is working great. It has RGB that cycle through colors, if you like that sort of thing. I can take it or leave it. It is wireless and has a rechargeable battery and it can be used while charging, so no down time. It is a nice gaming mouse."
Spenser Davis,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022",So I've been researching and getting different mice. My fav before this was the Corsair dark core wireless and this BLOWS it out the water. It's a little chunkier but I have fat hands. Hyper scroll ? No idea what it could even be used for. If it's on my pages go up and down without touching it. Software is best and easiest software I have used. Very light compared to the others feels like air. Comes with 2 4g weights and 4 2g weights. I put one 2g on each side and it feels magical. Will 100% be looking at more Logitech stuff. Downside is the mouse isn't white. I want a white one. Rgb hardly. I always say more rgb=higher k/d . Not with this my accuracy is better than ever. 10/10 recommend. The only thing I see future wise causing issues is scroll wheel has 3 clicks and within a week they feel slightly loose .

C. Conner,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2020","First, if your here to see if this Special Edition version also has the 16k Hero sensor, yes it does.

Allot of reviewers either praised this mouse for working well with their long fingers or being great for palm grip so I was worried at first that this mouse might make my hand hurt, (I've worked in a call center for almost 16 years and did allot of carpentry before that so I have carpal tunnel and arthritis too). I'm happy to say that as a claw user with shorter fingers there have been zero issues or pain from this mouse, (though when using the side thumb button I do have to reach a bit, but I like it this way as I can't accidentally hit it). If anything this mouse has tricked my hand into relaxing more into something closer to palm grip, (which is likely why it's more comfortable than my old mouse). The other buttons are very easy to get to and have a nice firm click. If you own any other Logitech products this has the same braided cable as their other gaming gear, it's strong with plenty of length and has a Velcro tie built in to make cable management a breeze. If you've never used a mouse with one of these 16K Hero sensors your gonna be blown away, so pinpoint accurate and lightning fast. The variable weight system is great with allot of options to chose from. I have a bad habit of picking up my mouse and moving it from years of using low DPI mouses so I have it heavy on the front and rear. This along with the super fast sensor are slowly helping me break that habit. Running the software in default makes the thumb button drop the DPI from whatever you have it set to, (top buttons left click side adjust DPI) to the slowest for pinpoint movement making it great for those doing video, audio, or Photoshop work.

TLDR:
Overall this is just a great quality bang for your buck mouse that can wear many hats and please almost anyone."
Jacob,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020","UPDATE 2024/03/26: For maybe the past few months I've been experiencing degraded performance of the left-click button. Specifically, when I try to highlight text (click and drag) the selection often changes like I quickly released and re-clicked even though I have the button depressed the whole time. I am a pretty casual mouse user, I don't do left-click-intensive activities at all, so this is kind of disappointing. Maybe I can open it up and clean it to fix the problem myself. I really like the mouse, so I'd be disappointed if it became usable for this reason.

UPDATE 2021/03/18: I actually downloaded the G hub software and did a bit of customization. I disabled the left scroll wheel button, since I accidentally hit it so often when trying to middle click. I also increased DPI a bit (max is >25000 now?!) and set the DPI shift button so I can easily switch to a less sensitive DPI for accurately drawing pixel art or adjusting volume. Very nice features.

This mouse hasn't had any paint wear/peeling issues like my last (cheap) one. Despite the scroll wheel not being rubber, I think it feels just fine. I haven't used any weights, and I don't really know why I would. I use a palm-ish grip, and I have a medium size hand.

Since getting this mouse, I've switched from a ""normal"" DPI to max, and it is so nice being able to navigate my computer with fine movements. I can move my cursor across all three of my monitors by rotating my hand ~1.5 inches.

My only complaint is that the left button seems to be a bit sensitive. Maybe it's the way I hold the mouse, but in a 2D scrolling environment, it's easy to accidentally hit the left scroll button when holding down the wheel. I have to make a concerted effort to ensure that I am pressing the wheel straight down. It would also be nice if the DPI button was harder to press just so I don't hit it by accident, but that is very rare anyways.

When I bought this, it was on sale for $37. For that value, this mouse is 5 stars (so far). If I had spent ~$55 or more, this would be 4 stars. Overall a great mouse."
Inko,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021","Overall I really like this product and think it is built nicely with quality plastics. It is a comfortable size and has a nice feel to it when holding it. My old mouse was much slimmer and annoying to hold unlike the g502 which when playing games or just in general doing work for prologned amounts of time definitely is a more comfortable hold. The thumb rest is really nice, i was worried because most of the review videos i watched were people with bigger hands so I thought maybe it wasn't going to sit right with me but it ended up being very nice and i really like it.

The program (Logitech G Hub) is very nice and runs smoothly. The lighting is very easy to change and you can basically custom make any color you want for the logo and primary lighting. It also has a bunch of preset affects for the lighting aswell. The dpi is very easy to set depending on what you want to set it as and also what other dpi's you want to set without having to open the program instead just clicking a button on the mouse right next to the primary clicker. The programable buttons themselves are very nice and easy to set. I don't really set all of them only 2 the rest are set to the default.

All in all I recommend this mouse to everyone and anyone who wants to upgrade from their current mouse."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","This is my favorite mouse that I've ever owned. I play a lot of FPS games. I like the fact that you can program the side buttons to whatever you want, including multiple key presses. The build quality is great, it's a Logitech they always get this right for me. The feel of this mouse in my hand is perfect for me. I dont have very big hands, so I dont have issues with grip at all. It comes with weights that you can put in to make the mouse heavier if you like it that way. Ths lights are nice, you can change the color, the way it shines, and if you want have no lights at all. I have another G502 that is all black. The special edition has white accents. It's not overly done, and it looks very nice in hand. The wheel can be unlocked and free spun. I mainly do that for entertainment. The braided cord is very nice, long enough to reach a good distance. You can install software that controls DPI, profiles for different games or programs.

Pros: Great for gaming, quality of material is superb, the accuracy of the laser is second to none, programmable buttons, and profiles, RGB lighting effect that can be changed. Comfortable for extended gaming sessions.

Cons: Have to install software to get all the functions, the new software tries to detect what game or program you are using and switch profiles for you, sometimes gets it wrong."

Name,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","EDIT 10/13/2021: About a year ago this mouse started double clicking and I replaced it with a basic Microsoft ergonomic mouse that hasn't suffered the same problem. The mouse didn't even last a year. Logitech clearly cheaped out on the switches.

My first G502 was the old one that didn't even have RGB, and cost $80 from Walmart. It lasted me about 3 years, before the left click would behave strangely. When I was clicking and dragging, it would just stop dragging all of a sudden, while I was still holding down the mouse. I'm not sure of whether or not this was a normal problem, or if it was a result of me literally breaking off the plastic for the left mouse button and super-gluing it back on, but it was enough of a reason for me to buy the new model nonetheless. If you don't manage to snag the mouse button on something and break it off, this thing should last you a long while."

Evan Munemura,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","I've played all sorts of games and made so many macros for every single one of them. I've played this with every kind of genre you can think of: MMOs, first persons, third persons, strategy, RPGs, and even platformers. It honestly comes at the best value because of how flexible this mouse can potentially be to cater any personal preference. Eventually you will notice some wear over time, but since it's priced relatively low you get so much value if you play games a ton.

The only complaint I can think of is that the software used to make macros and adjust DPI settings, Logitech G Hub, is a bit finicky at times. Sometimes it doesn't start when booting up a game and trying to figure out how to use it properly can take some time to get used to. But once you familiarize with the program it opens up to so many possibilities for customization."
Sithtiger,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2020","So I still have the original Logitech G502 Proteus Core. I paid $70 for that mouse and it's still working! The only issue I had was I had some dust get stuck down in the mouse wheel sensor that I inadvertently put thereby trying to clean it with a compressor. Anyway, I managed to fix it without having to dismantle it, using the same process but I digress.

This one is the Logitech G502 SE Hero and it was on sale for $35 and it's normally, well I don't know because I can't find any other price. When I look at another competing site which I won't mention, it too has the same price. I have found that the Hero has replaced the G502 Proteus Spectrum which goes for $50 and the only difference is the SE Hero has a new ""Hero 16K Sensor"" which boasts...well 16,000 DPI vs the measily G502 Proteus Spectrum has ONLY 12,000 DPI (as if anyone even needs that amount of sensitivity) but seriously I LOVE the edition of the RGB lighting.

OK, so for the review. I don't have much to say honestly amazing so far. It's exactly the same as my old Proteus Core, but I just had to play with the SE Hero because of the sweet white black and white version. It's so very responsive and the toggle button that lets you lower the DPI with the flick of a switch and you're sniping like a pro. I love the weighted system they brought back. Why mess with perfection. The ONLY thing I don't like is the cord, which of course can be remedied by buying the G502 Lightspeed. If I had the money I'd buy it.

Look, if you're looking for a good gaming mouse or simply just a good mouse, you'd be crazy not to pick one up at the current price point if you have the money! There is an all-black version just like the G502 Proteus Spectrum but it is identical in every way to the SE Hero save the look of it. I don't have any cons to this in all honesty. Actually I have one small complaint. So if you need a mouse, look no further. Great mouse, the best out there."

X,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023","I've never seen such a contraption before.
A mouse for a computer, they say it's for gaming,
But I want it to crochet, to help me keep scoring.

Logitech they call it, with RGB lighting so bright,
And a sensor so precise, it's the best they've ever made.
It can go up to 16,000 DPI, such a sight,
And with five tunable weights, it can be perfectly weighed.

I reckon it can help me in my crochet work,
Make my stitches more precise, and my patterns not a mess.
And I heard that with this mouse, I can play Fortnite,
A game where you build and shoot, sounds like a fine contest.

But alas, I'm new to this mouse, and I must confess,
I'm not sure how to use it, or how it can be of aid.
But I'm willing to learn, and I'm sure I'll progress,
With this Logitech G502 SE Hero, I won't be afraid.

Maybe I'll become a pro gamer, or a crochet master too!"

Austin Bergquist,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019","As an avid gamer, your peripherals are just as important as your PC and games. Its the peanut butter to the jelly. I bought my first G502 Proteus about 3 years ago, and I fell in love with it. You will read a lot of negative reviews about the GHub software, and while there is a small learning curve, I firmly believe the people that have issues with it are just not learning how to use it properly. It is simple. The mouse itself it wonderful, the three thumb buttons are so easy to hit separately, and the rest of them are simple with your pointer finger. You can program them to execute Windows tasks, and even run macros, or something as simple as returning to your desktop. Which is my favorite because sometimes Ill be in the middle of a full-screen game, and instead of doing the good ol' control alt delete, task manager, desktop, you can hit one button on your mouse, and youre at the desktop without actually closing your application. It makes switching button assignments easy, even mid game. Because of this I was able to even win a game because I wanted to switch a key, so I did that in under 10 seconds and I was back to my fullscreen game.

This mouse is not for people with large hands, or palm-grippers. It is a hybrid claw/palm, after long periods of time your pinky and ring finger will feel a little sore/tense. Slap some Bengay on and have your mom heat up a hot pocket and youre good to go.

Lets not forget the price, $35 for this mouse that has the Hero sensor? I paid $80 for my G502 three years ago.

Buy. This. Mouse."
Smalls,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2020",I didn’t realize how bad my skates were on my original g502 until I received this new mouse. I am VERY happy with my much needed upgrade. $29 For the special edition model is a steal and can’t be beat anywhere. I noticed the mouse Cable has also been upgraded to a stronger material as my last cable had a weird kink in it over time. The new cable Is a nylon material where as the old model was a cloth like braided material (see photos). I also noticed the mouse wheel no longer has a rubber like feel and is now lower quality plastic material. It’s very hard to notice the difference but it’s definitely changed a bit. Software is near identical but i was a bit bummed all my profiles from my old mouse didn’t transfer over to the new one. This was the only downside of upgrading. As far as the hero sensor vs the original I personally haven’t noticed a difference except for the fact the mouse glides across my mouse pad so much better but this is due to my old skates on my original mouse. So if you are contemplating about upgrading your mouse don’t hesitate as $29 for the special edition is definitely worth it. I was originally considering ordering new mouse skates for my old g502 but for $15 more I was able to get a completely new and up to date mouse with the hero sensor. The special edition mouse can be kind of confusing to find since it doesn’t show up in the actual amazon search results. You have to select the standard black g502 and select color as “Se” from the drop down options.
Th3PwnyExpress,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019",The logitech G502 is my new all time favorite mouse. I'm coming from a corsair m65 elite as my last mouse and the feel is similar being an asymmetrical mouse but the G502 is a bit narrower and more friendly to smaller hands. All buttons feel quality. The right side where the ends of my ring and pinky finger go has a very slightly inward profile that makes it much more comfortable to have a hard grip on for a long time like when playing fast paced first person shooters and makes lift up to recenter very easy. The distance to lift off is very small and is great for reaction time for fast paced gaming as well. The speed scroll wheel is my favorite feature. It can be switched to a regular detent-ed roller for normal rolling but after using this I think the speed scroll wheel is how all mice should be. When scrolling through a long menu you can just flick it and let it spin. About 30 seconds of playing around with it is all you need to learn how hard to flick it to alter the speed that your scrolling up or down and its great if you need to get all the way to the top or bottom of any window just one quick flick and this bad boy will keep rolling for several seconds. The wheel is light enough that a light finger tap on top of the spinning wheel will immediately stop the scrolling for precise control. I would say this is one of the best gaming mice and my all time favorite plus it has the best scroll wheel of all time.

█████,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2020","Currently cheaper than the other models of G502 that I was waiting for a discount on. Two different software to customize the mouse how you like. Personally, I just go with the legacy software, LCore. You can change a lot of settings with this mouse including the buttons, dpi, color of lighting or just turn off the light like I do. This has multiple buttons and layouts you can set which is great for that certain game or program. I have settings that allow me to quickly switch to the browser tab on the left and right and refresh the page which is extremely helpful and one of the top reasons I bought this. The scroll wheel is kind of hit or miss. I don't like it when I depend on an accurate scroll in a game or on a website but when I get the right place it sometimes goes back up a notch and I miss. Seems to happen pretty frequently too. You get used to it eventually. Free-scrolling is fun to use on long webpages. I don't really feel a difference with the weights in my opinion, but I just put it all on to keep it heavy. A good mouse for the price. If you need a new mouse maybe choose this one.
Pros
Pretty cheap price
Good Quality and feel
Customizable buttons that can be saved on hardware so you don't need to open up their software for a different layout
Lighting
Free-scroll is fast and fun
strong cable
SE is arguably cooler than the regular version and cheaper
Cons
Scroll wheel might not be accurate"
boniverismyhero,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","As a software engineer for, the scroll wheel on this mouse alone, I would shell out another $100. It’s so beautiful to scroll through 18,000 lines of code or endless rows of databases. I will never use a mouse without a weighted wheel. Even for normal web browsing, I can zip instantly down the page over thousands of lines.

The cable is light and long. It never gets in the way. The clicky buttons are solid. The RGB lighting looks great. I also like the weights. I prefer a heavy mouse, and if you add each weight, it’s a perfect feel.

I have huge hands, and this touches in my palm. If you’re coming from the vertical mouse the ergonomic angle is very natural.

Cons:
The “sniper” button is useless for me. The sensitivity button indicator is nice, but sometimes it’s not correct. You’ll notice right away if it’s off, so not a big deal.

The mouse is a little bit narrow. My pinky drags on the desk. I don’t mind it, again coming from vertical mouse, this is life for us."
John,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019","This is a great gaming mouse! Based on everything I've read, it (the G502 SE Hero) is functionally identical to the regular wired G502 Hero, with only aesthetic differences; it even shows up as a regular/black G502 Hero in Logitech Gaming Software. I've found LGS to be very easy to use and reliable, so I have not tried the G Hub software.

I have recently used a 1st Gen Logitech MX Master for regular use and a Logitech G700 for gaming. While the G502 is comfortable for me (medium size hands), the MX Master was the most comfortable of the three. G502 and G700 have a similar shape, with the latter being slightly wider. While I still love the MX Master, the G502 is still good for non-gaming use.

While I was hesitant to switch from wireless to wired, I have a mouse bungee (a generic $5 one) and have not had any problems. The $100+ price difference is also nice! I do miss being able to easily turn on and off the mouse, to switch between gaming and non-gaming mice because there seemed to be an issue with having both the MX Master and G502 connected at the same time (not sure if this will be an issue for anyone else though)."

klwong36,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020","I had been using an old Logitech MX1000 as my primary mouse, because it had enough programmable buttons to have the functionality that I needed, and it was responsive enough for me. The problem, of course, is that you can't replace the rechargeable battery in it, and the thing is now 15 years old.

Now I see a reasonably priced Logitech with 11 buttons, and a very nice Hero sensor, and this has proved a very capable replacement to the MX 1000 so far. I like the adjustable weights. I don't play the kind of games where a light mouse helps me, so I have all the weights installed, and they give the mouse a good hefty feel in my hand. Without them, the mouse feels a bit flimsy, as the plastic body is very light.

The reviewer who complained about the slipperiness of the scroll wheel ... I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you. The wheel turns as needed, and is responsive to my touch. Obviously you had a different experience, and I was a little concerned when I read your review, but I have found that it works well for me."

I hate using a mouse so when I have to I prefer not keep switching between mouse and keyboard. The buttons give me the option to use the mouse and with a couple clicks can do the functions I regularly do without moving back to the keyboard etc.

The only 2 draw back are the material feels cheap and it is not as ergonomic as the G700. The material feels like cheap plastic and was not what I was expecting for a “Heroic” edition. The size is smaller than the G700 and not as ergonomic when using it for long gaming sessions. It is not too small just getting used to it and will continue to use it."
Gevin Huey,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020","I owned the G502 Proteus & loved it. I only grabbed this G502 Hero because it was discounted to 30 bucks, and ought to be a mild upgrade. Whatever, I'll take my old G502 to my work's PC and upgrade the 'ol generic mouse they got there & keep the G502 Hero for my home PC. A G502 everywhere I go. Again, I love the G502. Feels great & work perfect. One criticism is that, in person, this Special Edition version is honestly kinda ugly. Buuuuuut how often do you even look at your mouse? You slap your hand on it & just get to work. No biggie. &, for 1/2 the price, I'll learn to not hate it. That being said, if you haven't already made your purchase, I'd strongly suggest going with the classic sexy black basic model. Your money, your call, the white outlines just don't do much for me (probably why it's the one on such deep discount) Right now the G logo on the mouse is gliding from color to color. I know there are settings I could use upon it. I won't. It's fine. Functionally, I can't imagine a mouse being better than the G502."
Jameson Mayer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2021","Edit: I figured it out. There’s a button to change how the scroll wheel works.

Right out of the box, the scroll wheel is less functional than any other mouse I've had. The design allows the wheel to scroll with its own momentum, which is kind of cool. However, the action of lifting my finger off the mouse after scrolling UP causes the scroll wheel to spin DOWN about a quarter of a rotation, causing my webpages or anything else I am in scroll down a few times. For example, I can scroll to the top of a webpage and it will immediately scroll back down once I am at the top.

Otherwise, the mouse feels very comfortable, looks nice, and the buttons are placed correctly where I won't accidentally press them. Unfortunately I need a mouse I can use for work and the scrolling issue makes this a no go for me. First Logitech product I didn't love."
Jake,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","The Logitech G hub software has to be installed with this product for you to get the full value. I have tied keyboard shortcuts as macros to the buttons that make my work so much easier. The profiles are a little difficult to understand. You can’t beat the price for how efficient this mouse can make you at your job.

I don’t game anymore like I used to. I played WoW and would create macros for specific combinations of spells. This made farming way more efficient as you could cut down time between spells."
Kenton Yoder,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022","I use a ""palm-style"" grip for this mouse. and I have fairly large hands. It works great for me. Very comfortable, great tactile response to the button presses, thumb rest is perfect. Love the free-scrolling wheel. I can't live without it since I first used one years ago. Quality of build seems very good to me. I've been using it for several months now for general purpose web browsing, content creation, and some gaming--mainly RPGs. I don't play fast-twitch shooters so I can't comment, but performance is smooth and lag free for everything I do."
Shalini,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020","I got this mouse for an amazing price and was extremely excited to try it out. Yet after only a few minutes of playing a game I noticed a problem. This mouse does not work with the way I hold mice during games. This mouse forces you to lay your hand flat and use your entire palm, where as I grab the mouse with my fingertips.

Disregarding that this was not for my grip style, I would say anyone that does use a mouse in this way will be extremely happy with this mouse. The accuracy is incredible and the swappable weights make setting it up for your exact play style just amazing. Also the app allows for any button to be mapped just in general but per game. You can also change your DPI increments to any numbers you want instead of just preset amounts.

If this mouse fit my grip style I would have looked no further for a mouse especially at this price. If you palm your mice look no further this is the mouse you have been looking for."
Nash,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","I got one of these mice a few years back and let's just say I have never, ever been interested in trying any other mouse. The extra mouse bindings, color features, ease of use, lockable scroll wheel.. endless top notch features. I bought this one as a backup... in case my one that's 3 years old ever needs to retire (I have used it for intense gaming on a daily basis for these 3 years and it works just the same as it did when it was new!)"
Daniel P,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021","If you're not right-handed, or don't like relatively heavy mice (121g), don't buy it.

Now, if you don't mind that, then boy are you in for a ride.
I had a G502 Proteus Spectrum before this, which was good, but OH BOY did this mouse make the previous one feel like a handicap. The new HERO sensor (which goes up to 25.6K dpi now after an update, although this doesn't matter and is mostly a flex) is bafflingly precise. No matter the speed with which you flick, how dirty your mousepad is or if you mistreat it.
However, the scroll wheel stopped working because something broke inside. I provided the needed info (video with mouse and serial number on the cable) and Logitech sent me a replacement.
Honestly, if I ever were to change a mouse, I'd just get the G502 lightspeed. There is no possible competitor for this outside of Logitech's own lineup."
Lian,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022",I love the mouse. Gaming with it is so nice and I've noticed improvements. My mouse pad is pretty clean with no debris and the bottom part of the mouse. The grip or the glider thing on the bottom of my mouse is peeling off. It didn't last as long as I'd hoped. This ruined my gaming experience because while gliding with my mouse it would just stop abruptly like tripping over a rock. Is there any way I can get customer support with this and get sent new grips for the bottom of my mouse?
Kyle,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2023",I’ve used the 502 for a few years. I had the black one for over four years before the left click started to give out. It’s a good price for a good mouse. Only complaint is the click seems more sensitive than the last one I had. Also I love the thumb rest I don’t think I can use a mouse without it now.
Will F.,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2021","I'd like to preface this review by saying I do spend most of my free time using my computer with this mouse. So pretty much daily I spend anywhere from 2-8 hours using this mouse. I am not overly hard on this mouse. I purchased this on November 30, 2019 for black Friday. A few months ago my G502 SE Hero's right mouse button's switch started failing. My previous mouse was a Roccat Kone XTD which I purchased back in 2015 when I bought a Laptop for college. It was still working fine when I replaced it in 2019 I just wanted something new with more features and newer software that worked well with Windows 10. That being said I've been very happy with the Logi Software. TLDR as of writing the right mouse button started failing about 2 months ago May 2021."
J,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I bought this as an upgrade to my 6-year-old G402. I wanted a good general-purpose mouse that I could use for light gaming. The G502 SE Hero works pretty well for me.

About the same size and shape as the G402. Slightly smaller than the G602 wireless mouse. I like the size of the G602 more, but the G502 is good enough. Weighs about the same as the G402, although the G502 comes with weights that I didn't use.

There are two buttons to the left of the left mouse button that change DPI. I used these to set the DPI to the same resolution as my G402. Didn't need to spend any time getting used to it.

The scroll wheel is somewhat different. Heavier than any the wheel on any other mouse I've used, and it's somewhat slippery. I've gotten used to it, but I'd prefer a regular scroll wheel.

There's a ""G"" logo on the mouse that by default fades from one color to another.

I didn't install any software."
Jeanine Sunshine,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","I love this mouse for how accurate it is and how you can easily change DPI. Perfect for FPS games and even for league. The metal spin wheel really doesn’t need the rubber like people are complaining about, it responds perfectly fine free or not. I have giant manly hands and it fits nicely. If I had a complaint it’s just that if I don’t have my hand positioned perfectly on the mouse, I bump the buttons by my thumb on accident a lot, so every time I play I need to think about how it’s positioned. You don’t really notice til it happens. The software it comes with it pretty intuitive and has a lot of options. Love how you can set everything for each different game you play so you don’t have to fumble to remember to change settings. I’ve been using Logitech gear since 2008, they haven’t let me down yet. Got the mouse on sale around Black Friday time for a great price, I couldn’t pass it up and I’m glad I didn’t."
MB,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020",I have been using Logitech gaming mice for a long time. They always hold up pretty well over time and are build really well. I upgraded from a 500s which was great for the past 3 years of heavy use but finally started to have tracking issues. I never had an issue with the way it tracked being a Laser mouse but now that I have experienced this optical sensor on the 502se I don't think I will ever go back. Its SO smooth! Can't say enough about the tracking accuracy. Its the best I have experienced. All the buttons are very tactile and snappy. Left and Right click have a very short travel and extremely fast for FPS games. Love the mouse overall. The only two things I would say for people with smaller hands is that its not the shortest mouse from palm to fingertips. Its seems designed for larger hands. And the sniper button is a bit too far forward. I really wish it was about 1/4 inch back.
Alex,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023",Side button (small one) was sticky at first and wouldn't register clicks that well. I thought it would be a problem but after playing with it a bit it started to work consistently... I don't know what that was all about but overall this gaming mouse is legit! I used the other G502 before and it was amazing (and didn't have side button issues). Overall I believe the G502 Hero mice to be the best on the market for competitive gaming.
Moses Sanchez,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2020","Ok when I went to look for a mouse online I went in blind and didn't look up any reviews and was mainly looking for wired products so here starts the review:
This mouse excel's my expectations which I'm glad it does but for people with big hands this might be of concern. So this mouse comes with weights which is a plus and Stickers, not needed but more swag and of course the mouse which you can program three top buttons (including left and right mouse clicks) and three in the side plus you can lock your scroll wheel on the fly so if I had any downsides to this mouse it be the size, even for a decently sized hand it is small mainly it's very narrow but after using it extensively I got used to it and still is a problem but not as glaring. So if there is anything you wish to take away from this review just not that this mouse is meant for medium to small hands not for huge hands."
Frostbite,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","This is one of the few mice I've owned in the past 10 years that hasn't started double clicking side buttons or main buttons in 6 months or less. Just for that at the sale price it was on, wonderful value. Fits my right hand like a glove and has a great sensor, never feel it spins out or jitters from my use. G-Hub software sucks compared to the old stuff Logitech uses and seems to want to brick my 502 so I've ignored the firmware updates. Get it together, Logitech. Stop using low quality switches in nearly everything while you're at it."
Alan,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","Pros:
+Nice and light (no weights)
+Availability of weights to fine tune it
+Multiple on-board profiles (preferable to using G-Hub)

Cons:
-G hub is not as intuitive as it could be, some things could be less buried

Other thoughts:
In my case, it seems that the primary button switches are going wonky. I find myself zooming in and out more than intended when playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint but other times I'll have no problems whatsoever. I haven't thoroughly tested the left click yet but I have experienced similar issues in the same game. Not so much in others.

Edit 7/16/2020:?Yeah, I'm definitely experiencing intermittent switch failure with the right mouse button. That kind of blows, I really like this mouse. For now I've set as many games to ""toggle aim"" as I can but I am definitely going to be shopping for a new one when I have the ability."
amxcoder,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020","This is the best mouse I have ever owned. I don't do gaming. I just do normal tasks plus video and photo editing. This mouse has programmable buttons and a feel I like a lot. I did not give it any stars for gaming because I don't do gaming. One of my favourite features on this mouse is the wheel. If you push the button next to it you get it to freewheel and one push of the wheel will go a very long way. If you don't want it to freewheel you just push the button again and you get clicks as you rotate the wheel. I admire the designer. The changing RGB colors on the mouse are wasted on me. My wife likes them. I can't think of any improvements they could do. Well, if it could read my mind about what I wanted to do and then execute those commands it would be better."
Shane,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020","I use palm grip and mostly drive with my wrist and I love this mouse. Fits my hand perfectly with my thumb resting on the most forward side button, but the other 2 are easy to reach as well. Not sure what size my hand is but I'm 5'11 and feel like I have average hands, maybe on the small side of average (can palm a mini bball, cant palm a full sized bball).

Infinitely scroll is very nice as well for web browsing or big excel sheets.

The rgb looks good but the software isnt great. It's not bad once you get the hang of it but could be a bit user friendly. I just set the buttons and haven't used it much besides that except to play with the rgb.

I went to BestBuy and got my hands on a big range of mice and liked this the best. Waited for a sale and pulled the trigger, no regrets."
Benjamin D. Alexander,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","Yes, I'm one of those oddballs your mom warned you about, a tip gripper!

My Daedalus 303 started double clicking randomly when I was single clicking, so I needed a new one. Well, those are out of production, so after doing a bunch of research, in many ways this mouse was the closest direct replacement in terms of features. Now having used it for number of months, I can say this unit is far more comfortable than the previous, with the same level of sensitivity.

I play all sorts of different types of game, FPS and MMO being the most prevalent, and it feels good in all the types I have tried. If you're a tip gripper, or a claw, I think you will really like this mouse. If you're into a palm grip, it's ok, but I'd recommend you look for something a little different, but it would still work well."
Ayaan,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020","The Logitech G502 is a really good mouse. I got it at a good price because it’s often on sale, and I believe it was worth every dollar. The programmable buttons make gaming more fun because now I don’t have to reach all the way across the keyboard, I can set far keybinds to the extra mouse buttons. The shape of the mouse fits my hand amazingly. I used to have a small cheap mouse that cramped my hand up but with the G502 i’ve experienced nothing but comfort. It doesn’t feel cheap either, it’s plastic but it feels like such a high quality material that won’t break anytime soon unless you’re trying to break it. The scroll wheel is metal which makes it feel kind of premium to use. Overall I’d highly recommend this mouse. It’s wired but if that’s not your style, Logitech offers a wireless one for a higher price."

chesnutthouse,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","after using this mouse for a couple years, I can say that it's definitely worth the money. I like a heavyweight mouse, so the optional extra weights are great for me. the high DPI limit is something I love, because I typically turn mine way up. The Thumb rest is nice as well, since when I had my old mouse, I got callus buildup on the side of my thumb. The braided cable is also great because you don't get those weird kinks like with a rubber coated one."
Michael,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020","I received this as my first logitech mouse to use. I had been using the razer deathadder elite, and the glorious model o- upon getting this one, I did not even bother adding any of the weights. Used it few days mainly playing fps games. All the craze of light weight mouse are the best for fps. Well I decided to add all the weights to try it out, maki g it quite heavy compared to the other ones I have always used. My accuracy was a lot better and I absolutely love the heavier feel with the weights even tho using it for fps cod and bf type games. I did disable the 2 buttons by the left click after accidentally hitting them in the heat of battle. This fits my hand perfect as I have short wide hand and the deathadder elite was just too long of a mouse compared to this one."
Rae,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020","This mouse was exactly what I was looking for, I wanted more buttons to use for my game (mmorpg) I've bound all buttons except left an right click giving me 9 actions vs the 2 I had on my previous mouse. The software was easy to learn and install. No disk is required just download from there site. I'm very pleased that it allows different profiles for different things. I have one for desktop use and as soon as I open my game the mouse automatically changes to the game specific setting. I used different color of the lighting to indicate what profile the mouse is in. I currently use the auto profiles which for me are desktop wow and Minecraft. I'm assuming it goes off the games downloaded so it would probably be different for someone else. But having it already know what different profiles I need was extremely useful. Overall I love this mouse and plan on getting another for my husband."
James Kuhns,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022",I am very picky in my mouse. I have tried several different mouses and I just don't like the feel.

Gorton,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2021","This is my second one I bought as a spare during black friday. I currently am still using my original and love it. The button layout, weight and ergos are very good.
The included software also makes mapping the buttons to keys normally not available is very handy. Be fun if it came in more colors...but not worried about it.
The adjustable DPI goes from very very slow...to breath on it and the mouse is on the other side of the screen...seems a bit much but I have it set and dont change it.
Being able to disconnect the scroll wheel from the clicker is an unrealized cool idea. If you are on a large document it can fly down the page....or you could use the slider I guess."
Carol Campbell,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020","I've had this mouse for 8 months now with use almost every day, and I haven't had a single problem. It feels great in the hand, the buttons have endured, and the software is great. The one downside is the hefty weight of it (although when you have a mouse with 11 programmable buttons, I'm sure it's hard to get it much lighter). I play a lot of FPS's and the weight of it hasn't really made me less competitive. The biggest praises go to the build quality and the software. The matte finish on the plastic make finger prints non-existent, and the buttons are still clicky and responsive. The Logitech G Hub software is above and beyond any peripheral software I've seen. It makes this mouse so versatile and useful for gaming and productivity alike. I absolutely love this mouse, and, if this one breaks, I'll be replacing it with another g502."
Ari,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020","I am used to paying upwards of $75 for a gaming mouse but this one proves that is not necessary. My previous mouse was a G502 Proteus and it had seen a huge amount of use and was getting a little gross and the cable was fraying pretty badly. I looked up getting another one because it had a really good run when I discovered there was a new version for half the price without sacrificing any features and even had a better sensor I was sold. My hand is instantly at home on the Hero and everything feels exactly the same with a new more flexible cable that feels smoother and less likely to fray. The sensor seems smoother though it is difficult to tell because that could be from wear and dust on the Proteus. Anyway, 100% satisfied all around."
Lain,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020","This mouse, the Logitech G502 SE Hero, is at least a billion times better than the Logitech G403 Prodigy.
I was going to massively dislike Logitech mouses after having bought a used Logitech G403 Prodigy from Amazon from a seller in ""like new"" condition... but it was all scratched up and nasty. This is not only because the mouse was not in good condition, but also because the mouse itself was bad. The material of the G403 was prone to developing gunk, and the ""back"" button was so misplaced and prone to accidental presses constantly. Thankfully, this Logitech G502 SE Hero doesn't have any issues, and it goes above and beyond. I am really happy with this purchase of mine, especially when I thought I was completely doomed from there being no good mouse for around $30-40 (anything more than that, imo, is unnecessarily expensive). I am so happy this mouse; no more buyer's remorse and no more headaches. I highly recommend this."

I now use a wireless mouse, but not a day goes by where I don't contemplate plugging in ""old faithful"" From the ergonomics, to the classic free spin scroll wheel. It has always felt like more of an extension of my hand, than an accessory. If you can catch it for under $30 on sale, it is arguably one of the best wired mice at that price point.

As far as gaming it's got you covered its got a good weight to it, with and without the adjustable weights, and plenty of buttons. Also feels good to hold. If I had to get my brother a gift for his set up it would definitely be this mouse.

Chris L,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2020","I ""upgraded"" to this from the G602, which is wireless. I was happy with the G602 until the connection started randomly stuttering at times, which is frustrating when playing fast-paced FPS's. The G502 SE Hero, besides not having any wireless connectivity issues, has much higher sensitivity (16,000 DPI vs. 3200 DPI) and double the report rate (1,000 vs. 500). The difference is definitely noticeable. Bring in the 5-way scroll wheel and customizable LED lighting for a cherry on top. And of course, it takes advantage of Logitech's software profiles, which allow custom button maps for different programs (that is, a profile for each game you play, another for graphics editing software, another for your video editor, etc), that automatically activate based on the program being used. This is certainly a good mouse for gamers."

The weight of the g502 mouse isn't an issue for me when gaming as it feels lighter than the g602 because of it being a wired mouse. The response time is excellent with no issues in my book. I liked the g502 so much i bought a second for my home computer. I even convinced a coworker to purchase one. Btw, it does have the ability to change the color of the logo which is an added feature."

This is a solid mouse. It seems well constructed and despite all the hatred on the mouse wheel, I like it. The wheel is heavy (seems to be a solid piece of aluminum) and scrolls easily. The buttons have a slight tactile click so I know they've been activated but aren't obnoxiously loud. The cable braid seem heavy enough to stand against a good amount of abuse.

Overall this really is a very good mouse for a very good price."

It wouldn't drag and drop properly then while playing a game and trying to shoot arrows it would shoot several arrows before actually firing a good shot even though I was holding down the mouse button the whole time.

john,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2023",I’ve always struggled finding a good gaming mouse that fits my hand but this one works perfectly for someone with a bigger hands it’s also just a great mouse that has some good settings for programming however you want the only downside is the software it can be a bit buggy
Gavin,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023",This mouse works great I think it looks better than the regular
Jose Gallegos,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2020","This mouse is amazing. I got it when my g602 died out on me. The sensor is super responsible without being jittery, included weights make it so you can adjust the weight to something that feels great for you, as Id used a wireless mouse with 2 AA batteries inside I preffer mice with a bit of heft. The buttons on the mouse are all in pretty nice places and G hub makes it super easy to assign specific commands to easier to reach places. I'm not one for adjustable dpi or seperate profiles but the options for those are present and seem well implemented, better for me though the dpi and profile associated buttons can also be rebound! All in all, well worth the price"
Craig C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020","The Logitech g502 is one of the best gaming mice on the market. I have had the Proteus core for quite a few years, and I have now upgraded to this one. They all are amazing and they keep getting better with each generation. New sensor is extremely smooth and very responsive. The tuning software from Logitech and very user-friendly and the customization is nearly Limitless. I found the tangle free branded cord on the Hero SE very premium feeling. My last g502 lasted over 5 years and is still going so I expect great things from this one. Would definitely recommend this product at its normal MSRP, but as I just got this one for $35, picking it up was a no-brainer."
John,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019","It has ALL the things logitech has shoved into a gaming mouse and it's this cheap? The wireless version of this is more than 4 times the price.
I can no longer live without the left/right scroll wheel clicks for videos but they do wear out if you use them as much as I do. Or as accident prone, or plagued with as many sinister housepets as I am. No stars off bc every time I go to replace my mouse it's cheaper and better.
Came from a G700s to, well another G700s to a 502 Proteus to the Hero. The Hero sensor is great. I upped my personal DPI and speed by a thousand and am no less accurate in games. I should get another while they're cheap."
Vinna,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020","just started pc gaming and this thing is a game changer! love how you can change the dpi through either the dpi button or you can be more precise and use the logitech ghub software. you can change the color of the led inside the mouse and reassign the buttons. the dpi sniping button is okay, but i just remapped the button for something else. i LOVE how you can add and remove weights to this thing. i play with 3 weights on my mouse. this thing is very ergonomic, feels amazing. the cable is braided and non-removable. this mouse has a nice scrool wheel. its really cool how it can switch to a free spinning wheel. great mouse for gaming."
Rolling Hedgehog,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020","while I mainly play MMO games and I have large hands I have found this mouse nice to use. it is fairly comfortable (slightly smaller than my old mouse), and I like the weight. some people find it too heavy but I added all the weights and found it to be an ok weight (would have liked a bit heavier). as far as the programming and speed it is fantastic. I have not had any complaints with this mouse and have used it for some photoshop, WoW, final fantasy 14, borderlands 1-2, fallout, elder scrolls, etc

probably not pushing the limits of this mouse, but it is getting the job done and I am enjoying using it"
Sarah,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023","I've used the G502 for years and the SE is such a nice touch. The white accent is really cool, overall feel is amazing too.
Always recommend this mouse for anyone who needs those extra buttons during game time, while being comfortable to play with for hours."
Bookm_danno,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","I'm not a dishonest person and I tell you as it is. I'll make a brief pro and con list for your convenience

Pros:
all the dpi necessary for your games
The scroll wheel has a free-roll mode, and a stutter-scroll.
clicks are tactile
9 programmable buttons.

cons:
(nothing too serious in all matters)
Dpi adjusting gets to be a chore after a while, but you get the hang of it soon enough
No ""fire"" button or a button that will do 2 left clicks at one press (which some budget mice do have)
The Logitech logo the flashes the rgb colors is hidden by your hand 90% of the time, not sure of the whole point of RBG when your hand is on it XD"
NNB,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021","i thought it would be worse than the already-awesome Logitech G502, as it is a bit cheaper (i do not know the exact price but whatever) but i was proven wrong as it is literally a G502 with white accents.

I would recommend this mouse to anyone, just not for FPS (first person shooter) games.

The mouse's bulkiness and weight (even though its customizable) just isn't ideal for clicking heads and flicking, but its all down to personal preference.

Verdict is that it has its ups and downs, but this is still a good mouse overall"
Justin,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2021","I've had an original G502 Proteus Core for years, and my god the thing is indestructible, I've tripped over the wire for it and had it slam hard to the ground nearly daily since I've had it and not only has it never broken, it still hardly has a scratch on it.

This mouse is a rather simple upgrade, it looks nicer with the black and white, it has RGB lights instead of the solid logitech blue, and it has a better sensor although the original G502 sensors are just fine and you won't notice any difference really."
Alec Tillery,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2021","Was looking for a gaming mouse not too long ago due to the previous one giving into multiple wacks on my desk and came across this Logtech G502. Saw it came in a sweet Special Edition model that costed only a bit more so I saw screw it, ball out. After owning it for a while, it has served me well.

Also went on the Logitech website to do some digging and noticed the Logitech G502 is $79.99, so I definitely got the better deal here."
Ken Butcher,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023",My gamer son said this is a great mouse.
Brandon Kounovsky,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2019","Got it at a discount, and I feel it was completly with the $35. I've only used it a day and I feel like I have it figured out. The weight of the mouse without the added weight is kind of hefty compared to my last one, but honestly, I prefer it.
I love the fast scroll or controlled scroll feature too! This is the first time I've ever had a mouse of such quality!
I'd say the one downside is that you have to download the Logitech g hub to remap buttons as they are already preset to do things. Overall though, its a really nice product for the price, and once you figure everything out with a bit of research, an amazing mouse."
CJ,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020","I've been using the original G502 for the longest time, and it has always been trustworthy to be a good, fast responding mouse great for gaming, especially FPS gaming. This mouse is no different, great mouse, I love the feature where you can unlock the scroll wheel and the side buttons are incredibly useful. It has great precision with just about any mouse pad I've tried, including soft cloth ones and hard cover ones. I've also have never had any clicking issues with this mouse, and trust me, I left click quite a lot. It's a perfect fit for my hand and it's a perfect fit for any computer, especially any gaming rig. Would definitely recommend."
S. Culver,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019","Get the SE while you can. It’s an amazing price and what a deal. This is an amazing mouse with great button choices. Terrific button placement. Top of the line accuracy. Just an overall terrific mouse. I especially love the g-shift button. You can use this in games to have the dpi shift as you hold it and then return when you let go. Or for those like me, I use this mouse as a developer. I use the g-shift to basically allow we to switch to an alternate selection for the button. So with it held they do one action and when it’s not they do something else. It has allowed me to revolutionize my workflow in some very complex development tools"
Bishop,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2019","I just replaced my 2016 Razer Deathadder Chroma with this mouse because for the second time the middle click stopped working after 2 years of use. I wanted to try something different due to my ever growing hatred towards Razer products, and for over half the price this mouse is so much better. First of all, it is jam packed with features. The amount of extra buttons is great. The scroll wheel is also awesome as it can become a free spinning wheel at the press of a button, it can become a great tool in certain games or an addicting fidget toy. Not to mention the build quality, which is really good. This is a really good mouse, highly recommended."
Fred Savage,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021","When I first got this I was coming from a Logitech G300s Optical Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse (also purchased on Amazon). That mouse felt great but I would have issues when holding the Left Mouse Button in a game and having it treat it like I had let go and re-clicked. I haven't had that issue with this mouse. The only thing I disliked was the mouse felt weird at first after coming from the G300s but now, 1.5 months after purchase, it feels great. No issues for any of the games I play."
Jeff S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021",This mouse has a few great features. One is the scroll can be set to free scroll so there's no resistance or tactile feedback which is nice if you have pain in your wrist or hands. Also the software is very easy to use to create your own hotkeys and even macros on any of the buttons. The scroll wheel clicks left and right too for additional inputs. I have copy/paste on the left and right scroll wheel and back/forward on the thumb cluster buttons. Best mouse I've ever had.
J&J,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2023",Good Basic gaming mouse when you find it on sale
Reemy,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022","I work in DevOps, and being able to hotkey copy and paste to some of these buttons ends up saving me a lot of things me and effort. It might not seem like much, but it speeds up my ability to work greatly."
Blaine,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","I bought this as a gift for my husband, who is very involved with gaming and technology. He loves the placement, versatility, and number of buttons. He uses this on a cloth mousepad, and says there is no drag, and he is able to rest his hand comfortably on the mouse without his pinky touching the mousepad. I noticed some negative reviews about the scroll wheel before purchasing, and the scroll wheel does free spin, but it also has ridges. Neither of us have had a problem with it spinning when we didn't need it to or having any trouble with it. It has ridges as pictured."
Nick Lucarelli,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","I was getting tired of constantly having to replace $20-30 gaming mice and decided to take it a step up in quality. I was not disappointed in the least, this mouse is the smoothest one I’ve ever used. The extra buttons are very useful for bindings and the software is very easy to install and use, nothing difficult about it. You can customize the weight of the mouse as well, which I find very handy if you have a preferred weight you like your mouse to be at. I highly recommend investing in this mouse, it’s got the biggest bang for the buck as far as I’ve seen."
Eric Johnisee,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2023",I bought 2 of these for my boys. Both of my sons were very happy with these. They love the adjustable weights which make this feel much more substantial. Going to be buying one for myself as well.
Vang,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2019","It was this or the corsair harpoon, my husband end up loving and I never got the chance to try it. (Sad face) He likes the weight of the mouse, he also said that he saw a different while playing modern warfare. (Notsure because he still die but end up first place?) No problem with the scrolling thing nor the program for the mouse yet, will update if any issue arise. Oh, I end up getting the corsair, keep in mind they are completely different mouse so do your research.

UPDATE: After a few months of using it. I too have experienced the double clicking on this mouse.."
Saood D.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020",This is my second G502 mouse. Not because the old one broke or anything but because it’s such a great mouse. The cable is braided so it won’t drag or even get caught. The lights in the mouse are RGB. DPI switch is really nice to have along with its display. Scroll wheel has 2 settings. Different profiles can be set up. Super handy to have the page back and page forward buttons on the mouse. Includes weights to change how the mouse feels. Very little sliding resistance. Overall great product
April,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021","Works great so far. Ever since COVID I’ve been alternating days at home and in the office, and it’s made me realize that the gaming mouse I have at home is actually really fantastic for Excel as well. Particularly the Hyperscroll button! The shape and button layout of this one will take a bit of getting used to compared with my older G500, but I like that this model also includes weights so it feels nice and solid in my hand. Plus, great price."
Scott Stevens,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2022","I love this mouse and have one for all of my computers, gaming and business. I love that I can programs the buttons both for gaming and for common functions on my business computers. Logitech has always been a favorite and they never disappoint."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I bought this because numerous (even one or two reputable) sites list this as one of the best mice of 2019, and for good reason. The software works and the tracking is excellent.

My only complaints are that the scroll wheel over tracks a little when the locking switch is off and the bottom plate, that houses the weights, does not click into place, it uses a bit of suction to stay in place- I am a little uneasy about it but it is working for now. No points docked as the design is great and these are minor issues for the price point."
Rolland M. Weber,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020","Using this mouse mainly for GTA V and 7 Days to Die. Very quick response, no apparent lag and buttons in comfortable locations. The adjustable weights can be a little fiddly to get in place, but they make a lot of difference in the overall feel of this mouse. The mouse wheel has a button that lets it spin freely or click which is great for papers or long essays involving multiple pages and the software allows a lot of options to make this thing do just about anything you want it to. Overall, absolutely worth the money."
Rooster,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2022",i love these mouse just had the black hero give up on me after 2years from smashing and being aggressive would always recommend this mouse to folks that need a reliable and cheap mouse
