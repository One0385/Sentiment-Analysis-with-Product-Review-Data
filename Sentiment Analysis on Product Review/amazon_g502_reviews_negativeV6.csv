C. Conner,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2020","First, if your here to see if this Special Edition version also has the 16k Hero sensor, yes it does.

Allot of reviewers either praised this mouse for working well with their long fingers or being great for palm grip so I was worried at first that this mouse might make my hand hurt, (I've worked in a call center for almost 16 years and did allot of carpentry before that so I have carpal tunnel and arthritis too). I'm happy to say that as a claw user with shorter fingers there have been zero issues or pain from this mouse, (though when using the side thumb button I do have to reach a bit, but I like it this way as I can't accidentally hit it). If anything this mouse has tricked my hand into relaxing more into something closer to palm grip, (which is likely why it's more comfortable than my old mouse). The other buttons are very easy to get to and have a nice firm click. If you own any other Logitech products this has the same braided cable as their other gaming gear, it's strong with plenty of length and has a Velcro tie built in to make cable management a breeze. If you've never used a mouse with one of these 16K Hero sensors your gonna be blown away, so pinpoint accurate and lightning fast. The variable weight system is great with allot of options to chose from. I have a bad habit of picking up my mouse and moving it from years of using low DPI mouses so I have it heavy on the front and rear. This along with the super fast sensor are slowly helping me break that habit. Running the software in default makes the thumb button drop the DPI from whatever you have it set to, (top buttons left click side adjust DPI) to the slowest for pinpoint movement making it great for those doing video, audio, or Photoshop work.

TLDR:
Overall this is just a great quality bang for your buck mouse that can wear many hats and please almost anyone."
Jacob,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020","UPDATE 2024/03/26: For maybe the past few months I've been experiencing degraded performance of the left-click button. Specifically, when I try to highlight text (click and drag) the selection often changes like I quickly released and re-clicked even though I have the button depressed the whole time. I am a pretty casual mouse user, I don't do left-click-intensive activities at all, so this is kind of disappointing. Maybe I can open it up and clean it to fix the problem myself. I really like the mouse, so I'd be disappointed if it became usable for this reason.

UPDATE 2021/03/18: I actually downloaded the G hub software and did a bit of customization. I disabled the left scroll wheel button, since I accidentally hit it so often when trying to middle click. I also increased DPI a bit (max is >25000 now?!) and set the DPI shift button so I can easily switch to a less sensitive DPI for accurately drawing pixel art or adjusting volume. Very nice features.

This mouse hasn't had any paint wear/peeling issues like my last (cheap) one. Despite the scroll wheel not being rubber, I think it feels just fine. I haven't used any weights, and I don't really know why I would. I use a palm-ish grip, and I have a medium size hand.

Since getting this mouse, I've switched from a ""normal"" DPI to max, and it is so nice being able to navigate my computer with fine movements. I can move my cursor across all three of my monitors by rotating my hand ~1.5 inches.

My only complaint is that the left button seems to be a bit sensitive. Maybe it's the way I hold the mouse, but in a 2D scrolling environment, it's easy to accidentally hit the left scroll button when holding down the wheel. I have to make a concerted effort to ensure that I am pressing the wheel straight down. It would also be nice if the DPI button was harder to press just so I don't hit it by accident, but that is very rare anyways.

When I bought this, it was on sale for $37. For that value, this mouse is 5 stars (so far). If I had spent ~$55 or more, this would be 4 stars. Overall a great mouse."
Inko,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021","Overall I really like this product and think it is built nicely with quality plastics. It is a comfortable size and has a nice feel to it when holding it. My old mouse was much slimmer and annoying to hold unlike the g502 which when playing games or just in general doing work for prologned amounts of time definitely is a more comfortable hold. The thumb rest is really nice, i was worried because most of the review videos i watched were people with bigger hands so I thought maybe it wasn't going to sit right with me but it ended up being very nice and i really like it.

The program (Logitech G Hub) is very nice and runs smoothly. The lighting is very easy to change and you can basically custom make any color you want for the logo and primary lighting. It also has a bunch of preset affects for the lighting aswell. The dpi is very easy to set depending on what you want to set it as and also what other dpi's you want to set without having to open the program instead just clicking a button on the mouse right next to the primary clicker. The programable buttons themselves are very nice and easy to set. I don't really set all of them only 2 the rest are set to the default.

All in all I recommend this mouse to everyone and anyone who wants to upgrade from their current mouse."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","This is my favorite mouse that I've ever owned. I play a lot of FPS games. I like the fact that you can program the side buttons to whatever you want, including multiple key presses. The build quality is great, it's a Logitech they always get this right for me. The feel of this mouse in my hand is perfect for me. I dont have very big hands, so I dont have issues with grip at all. It comes with weights that you can put in to make the mouse heavier if you like it that way. Ths lights are nice, you can change the color, the way it shines, and if you want have no lights at all. I have another G502 that is all black. The special edition has white accents. It's not overly done, and it looks very nice in hand. The wheel can be unlocked and free spun. I mainly do that for entertainment. The braided cord is very nice, long enough to reach a good distance. You can install software that controls DPI, profiles for different games or programs.

Pros: Great for gaming, quality of material is superb, the accuracy of the laser is second to none, programmable buttons, and profiles, RGB lighting effect that can be changed. Comfortable for extended gaming sessions.

Cons: Have to install software to get all the functions, the new software tries to detect what game or program you are using and switch profiles for you, sometimes gets it wrong."

Name,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","EDIT 10/13/2021: About a year ago this mouse started double clicking and I replaced it with a basic Microsoft ergonomic mouse that hasn't suffered the same problem. The mouse didn't even last a year. Logitech clearly cheaped out on the switches.

My first G502 was the old one that didn't even have RGB, and cost $80 from Walmart. It lasted me about 3 years, before the left click would behave strangely. When I was clicking and dragging, it would just stop dragging all of a sudden, while I was still holding down the mouse. I'm not sure of whether or not this was a normal problem, or if it was a result of me literally breaking off the plastic for the left mouse button and super-gluing it back on, but it was enough of a reason for me to buy the new model nonetheless. If you don't manage to snag the mouse button on something and break it off, this thing should last you a long while."
Ian,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024","Works as well as the old Proteus it replaced, same feel. Glad to have it"
Timothy W.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2024","Great mouse, but I think Logitech wants to much for what it is. So do like I did and wait for it to go on sale."
Evan Munemura,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2023","I've played all sorts of games and made so many macros for every single one of them. I've played this with every kind of genre you can think of: MMOs, first persons, third persons, strategy, RPGs, and even platformers. It honestly comes at the best value because of how flexible this mouse can potentially be to cater any personal preference. Eventually you will notice some wear over time, but since it's priced relatively low you get so much value if you play games a ton.

The only complaint I can think of is that the software used to make macros and adjust DPI settings, Logitech G Hub, is a bit finicky at times. Sometimes it doesn't start when booting up a game and trying to figure out how to use it properly can take some time to get used to. But once you familiarize with the program it opens up to so many possibilities for customization."
Sithtiger,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2020","So I still have the original Logitech G502 Proteus Core. I paid $70 for that mouse and it's still working! The only issue I had was I had some dust get stuck down in the mouse wheel sensor that I inadvertently put thereby trying to clean it with a compressor. Anyway, I managed to fix it without having to dismantle it, using the same process but I digress.

This one is the Logitech G502 SE Hero and it was on sale for $35 and it's normally, well I don't know because I can't find any other price. When I look at another competing site which I won't mention, it too has the same price. I have found that the Hero has replaced the G502 Proteus Spectrum which goes for $50 and the only difference is the SE Hero has a new ""Hero 16K Sensor"" which boasts...well 16,000 DPI vs the measily G502 Proteus Spectrum has ONLY 12,000 DPI (as if anyone even needs that amount of sensitivity) but seriously I LOVE the edition of the RGB lighting.

OK, so for the review. I don't have much to say honestly amazing so far. It's exactly the same as my old Proteus Core, but I just had to play with the SE Hero because of the sweet white black and white version. It's so very responsive and the toggle button that lets you lower the DPI with the flick of a switch and you're sniping like a pro. I love the weighted system they brought back. Why mess with perfection. The ONLY thing I don't like is the cord, which of course can be remedied by buying the G502 Lightspeed. If I had the money I'd buy it.

Look, if you're looking for a good gaming mouse or simply just a good mouse, you'd be crazy not to pick one up at the current price point if you have the money! There is an all-black version just like the G502 Proteus Spectrum but it is identical in every way to the SE Hero save the look of it. I don't have any cons to this in all honesty. Actually I have one small complaint. So if you need a mouse, look no further. Great mouse, the best out there."
Nash Presnell,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","The only mouse I've ever wanted or needed. Last one I had lasted seven years and I replaced it with the exact same model, and that was only because of the mousewheel button losing tracking after much use.

Has all the buttons you need, more sensitivity profiles than you'll ever need, weight balancing, all around a good, solid, affordable mouse for any purpose."
X,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023","I've never seen such a contraption before.
A mouse for a computer, they say it's for gaming,
But I want it to crochet, to help me keep scoring.

Logitech they call it, with RGB lighting so bright,
And a sensor so precise, it's the best they've ever made.
It can go up to 16,000 DPI, such a sight,
And with five tunable weights, it can be perfectly weighed.

I reckon it can help me in my crochet work,
Make my stitches more precise, and my patterns not a mess.
And I heard that with this mouse, I can play Fortnite,
A game where you build and shoot, sounds like a fine contest.

But alas, I'm new to this mouse, and I must confess,
I'm not sure how to use it, or how it can be of aid.
But I'm willing to learn, and I'm sure I'll progress,
With this Logitech G502 SE Hero, I won't be afraid.

So let's give it a try, and see what it can do,
Maybe I'll become a pro gamer, or a crochet master too!"
Springfield,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2024",I love it. All the features that I needed. Good for big hands.
Austin Bergquist,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2019","As an avid gamer, your peripherals are just as important as your PC and games. Its the peanut butter to the jelly. I bought my first G502 Proteus about 3 years ago, and I fell in love with it. You will read a lot of negative reviews about the GHub software, and while there is a small learning curve, I firmly believe the people that have issues with it are just not learning how to use it properly. It is simple. The mouse itself it wonderful, the three thumb buttons are so easy to hit separately, and the rest of them are simple with your pointer finger. You can program them to execute Windows tasks, and even run macros, or something as simple as returning to your desktop. Which is my favorite because sometimes Ill be in the middle of a full-screen game, and instead of doing the good ol' control alt delete, task manager, desktop, you can hit one button on your mouse, and youre at the desktop without actually closing your application. It makes switching button assignments easy, even mid game. Because of this I was able to even win a game because I wanted to switch a key, so I did that in under 10 seconds and I was back to my fullscreen game.

This mouse is not for people with large hands, or palm-grippers. It is a hybrid claw/palm, after long periods of time your pinky and ring finger will feel a little sore/tense. Slap some Bengay on and have your mom heat up a hot pocket and youre good to go.

Lets not forget the price, $35 for this mouse that has the Hero sensor? I paid $80 for my G502 three years ago.

Buy. This. Mouse."
Smalls,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2020",I didn’t realize how bad my skates were on my original g502 until I received this new mouse. I am VERY happy with my much needed upgrade. $29 For the special edition model is a steal and can’t be beat anywhere. I noticed the mouse Cable has also been upgraded to a stronger material as my last cable had a weird kink in it over time. The new cable Is a nylon material where as the old model was a cloth like braided material (see photos). I also noticed the mouse wheel no longer has a rubber like feel and is now lower quality plastic material. It’s very hard to notice the difference but it’s definitely changed a bit. Software is near identical but i was a bit bummed all my profiles from my old mouse didn’t transfer over to the new one. This was the only downside of upgrading. As far as the hero sensor vs the original I personally haven’t noticed a difference except for the fact the mouse glides across my mouse pad so much better but this is due to my old skates on my original mouse. So if you are contemplating about upgrading your mouse don’t hesitate as $29 for the special edition is definitely worth it. I was originally considering ordering new mouse skates for my old g502 but for $15 more I was able to get a completely new and up to date mouse with the hero sensor. The special edition mouse can be kind of confusing to find since it doesn’t show up in the actual amazon search results. You have to select the standard black g502 and select color as “Se” from the drop down options.
Th3PwnyExpress,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019",The logitech G502 is my new all time favorite mouse. I'm coming from a corsair m65 elite as my last mouse and the feel is similar being an asymmetrical mouse but the G502 is a bit narrower and more friendly to smaller hands. All buttons feel quality. The right side where the ends of my ring and pinky finger go has a very slightly inward profile that makes it much more comfortable to have a hard grip on for a long time like when playing fast paced first person shooters and makes lift up to recenter very easy. The distance to lift off is very small and is great for reaction time for fast paced gaming as well. The speed scroll wheel is my favorite feature. It can be switched to a regular detent-ed roller for normal rolling but after using this I think the speed scroll wheel is how all mice should be. When scrolling through a long menu you can just flick it and let it spin. About 30 seconds of playing around with it is all you need to learn how hard to flick it to alter the speed that your scrolling up or down and its great if you need to get all the way to the top or bottom of any window just one quick flick and this bad boy will keep rolling for several seconds. The wheel is light enough that a light finger tap on top of the spinning wheel will immediately stop the scrolling for precise control. I would say this is one of the best gaming mice and my all time favorite plus it has the best scroll wheel of all time.

█████,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2020","Currently cheaper than the other models of G502 that I was waiting for a discount on. Two different software to customize the mouse how you like. Personally, I just go with the legacy software, LCore. You can change a lot of settings with this mouse including the buttons, dpi, color of lighting or just turn off the light like I do. This has multiple buttons and layouts you can set which is great for that certain game or program. I have settings that allow me to quickly switch to the browser tab on the left and right and refresh the page which is extremely helpful and one of the top reasons I bought this. The scroll wheel is kind of hit or miss. I don't like it when I depend on an accurate scroll in a game or on a website but when I get the right place it sometimes goes back up a notch and I miss. Seems to happen pretty frequently too. You get used to it eventually. Free-scrolling is fun to use on long webpages. I don't really feel a difference with the weights in my opinion, but I just put it all on to keep it heavy. A good mouse for the price. If you need a new mouse maybe choose this one.
Pros
Pretty cheap price
Good Quality and feel
Customizable buttons that can be saved on hardware so you don't need to open up their software for a different layout
Lighting
Free-scroll is fast and fun
strong cable
SE is arguably cooler than the regular version and cheaper
Cons
Scroll wheel might not be accurate"
boniverismyhero,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2021","As a software engineer for, the scroll wheel on this mouse alone, I would shell out another $100. It’s so beautiful to scroll through 18,000 lines of code or endless rows of databases. I will never use a mouse without a weighted wheel. Even for normal web browsing, I can zip instantly down the page over thousands of lines.

The cable is light and long. It never gets in the way. The clicky buttons are solid. The RGB lighting looks great. I also like the weights. I prefer a heavy mouse, and if you add each weight, it’s a perfect feel.

I have huge hands, and this touches in my palm. If you’re coming from the vertical mouse the ergonomic angle is very natural.

Cons:
The “sniper” button is useless for me. The sensitivity button indicator is nice, but sometimes it’s not correct. You’ll notice right away if it’s off, so not a big deal.

The mouse is a little bit narrow. My pinky drags on the desk. I don’t mind it, again coming from vertical mouse, this is life for us."
John,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019","This is a great gaming mouse! Based on everything I've read, it (the G502 SE Hero) is functionally identical to the regular wired G502 Hero, with only aesthetic differences; it even shows up as a regular/black G502 Hero in Logitech Gaming Software. I've found LGS to be very easy to use and reliable, so I have not tried the G Hub software.

I have recently used a 1st Gen Logitech MX Master for regular use and a Logitech G700 for gaming. While the G502 is comfortable for me (medium size hands), the MX Master was the most comfortable of the three. G502 and G700 have a similar shape, with the latter being slightly wider. While I still love the MX Master, the G502 is still good for non-gaming use.

While I was hesitant to switch from wireless to wired, I have a mouse bungee (a generic $5 one) and have not had any problems. The $100+ price difference is also nice! I do miss being able to easily turn on and off the mouse, to switch between gaming and non-gaming mice because there seemed to be an issue with having both the MX Master and G502 connected at the same time (not sure if this will be an issue for anyone else though)."
Jonathan N.,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2023",Always loved Logitech products. This one hasn't let me down. Only reason I had to buy another was lost in my move from my apartment to my house.
klwong36,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020","I had been using an old Logitech MX1000 as my primary mouse, because it had enough programmable buttons to have the functionality that I needed, and it was responsive enough for me. The problem, of course, is that you can't replace the rechargeable battery in it, and the thing is now 15 years old.

Now I see a reasonably priced Logitech with 11 buttons, and a very nice Hero sensor, and this has proved a very capable replacement to the MX 1000 so far. I like the adjustable weights. I don't play the kind of games where a light mouse helps me, so I have all the weights installed, and they give the mouse a good hefty feel in my hand. Without them, the mouse feels a bit flimsy, as the plastic body is very light.

The reviewer who complained about the slipperiness of the scroll wheel ... I'm sorry, but I can't agree with you. The wheel turns as needed, and is responsive to my touch. Obviously you had a different experience, and I was a little concerned when I read your review, but I have found that it works well for me."
DL,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2020","Enjoy the mouse. Got it replacing an older G700. I like the G700 more, the problem is the mouse isn’t supported with the newer software on a Mac.

The G502 works well for games and for general everyday use. The new version of the software still works on the newest version of OSX I like Razer or other gaming mice. I have profiles set for Games, Adobe products, general use, email filing, etc.

I hate using a mouse so when I have to I prefer not keep switching between mouse and keyboard. The buttons give me the option to use the mouse and with a couple clicks can do the functions I regularly do without moving back to the keyboard etc.

The only 2 draw back are the material feels cheap and it is not as ergonomic as the G700. The material feels like cheap plastic and was not what I was expecting for a “Heroic” edition. The size is smaller than the G700 and not as ergonomic when using it for long gaming sessions. It is not too small just getting used to it and will continue to use it."
Gevin Huey,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020","I owned the G502 Proteus & loved it. I only grabbed this G502 Hero because it was discounted to 30 bucks, and ought to be a mild upgrade. Whatever, I'll take my old G502 to my work's PC and upgrade the 'ol generic mouse they got there & keep the G502 Hero for my home PC. A G502 everywhere I go. Again, I love the G502. Feels great & work perfect. One criticism is that, in person, this Special Edition version is honestly kinda ugly. Buuuuuut how often do you even look at your mouse? You slap your hand on it & just get to work. No biggie. &, for 1/2 the price, I'll learn to not hate it. That being said, if you haven't already made your purchase, I'd strongly suggest going with the classic sexy black basic model. Your money, your call, the white outlines just don't do much for me (probably why it's the one on such deep discount) Right now the G logo on the mouse is gliding from color to color. I know there are settings I could use upon it. I won't. It's fine. Functionally, I can't imagine a mouse being better than the G502."
Jameson Mayer,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2021","Edit: I figured it out. There’s a button to change how the scroll wheel works.

Right out of the box, the scroll wheel is less functional than any other mouse I've had. The design allows the wheel to scroll with its own momentum, which is kind of cool. However, the action of lifting my finger off the mouse after scrolling UP causes the scroll wheel to spin DOWN about a quarter of a rotation, causing my webpages or anything else I am in scroll down a few times. For example, I can scroll to the top of a webpage and it will immediately scroll back down once I am at the top.

Otherwise, the mouse feels very comfortable, looks nice, and the buttons are placed correctly where I won't accidentally press them. Unfortunately I need a mouse I can use for work and the scrolling issue makes this a no go for me. First Logitech product I didn't love."
Jake,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023","The Logitech G hub software has to be installed with this product for you to get the full value.

Quality of build seems very good to me. I've been using it for several months now for general purpose web browsing, content creation, and some gaming--mainly RPGs. I don't play fast-twitch shooters so I can't comment, but performance is smooth and lag free for everything I do."
Shalini,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020","I got this mouse for an amazing price and was extremely excited to try it out. Yet after only a few minutes of playing a game I noticed a problem. This mouse does not work with the way I hold mice during games. This mouse forces you to lay your hand flat and use your entire palm, where as I grab the mouse with my fingertips.

Disregarding that this was not for my grip style, I would say anyone that does use a mouse in this way will be extremely happy with this mouse. The accuracy is incredible and the swappable weights make setting it up for your exact play style just amazing. Also the app allows for any button to be mapped just in general but per game. You can also change your DPI increments to any numbers you want instead of just preset amounts.

If this mouse fit my grip style I would have looked no further for a mouse especially at this price. If you palm your mice look no further this is the mouse you have been looking for."

Now, if you don't mind that, then boy are you in for a ride.
I had a G502 Proteus Spectrum before this, which was good, but OH BOY did this mouse make the previous one feel like a handicap. The new HERO sensor (which goes up to 25.6K dpi now after an update, although this doesn't matter and is mostly a flex) is bafflingly precise. No matter the speed with which you flick, how dirty your mousepad is or if you mistreat it.
However, the scroll wheel stopped working because something broke inside. I provided the needed info (video with mouse and serial number on the cable) and Logitech sent me a replacement.
Honestly, if I ever were to change a mouse, I'd just get the G502 lightspeed. There is no possible competitor for this outside of Logitech's own lineup."
Lian,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022",I love the mouse. Gaming with it is so nice and I've noticed improvements. My mouse pad is pretty clean with no debris and the bottom part of the mouse. The grip or the glider thing on the bottom of my mouse is peeling off. It didn't last as long as I'd hoped. This ruined my gaming experience because while gliding with my mouse it would just stop abruptly like tripping over a rock. Is there any way I can get customer support with this and get sent new grips for the bottom of my mouse?

A few months ago my G502 SE Hero's right mouse button's switch started failing. My previous mouse was a Roccat Kone XTD which I purchased back in 2015 when I bought a Laptop for college. It was still working fine when I replaced it in 2019 I just wanted something new with more features and newer software that worked well with Windows 10.

J,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I bought this as an upgrade to my 6-year-old G402. I wanted a good general-purpose mouse that I could use for light gaming. The G502 SE Hero works pretty well for me.

About the same size and shape as the G402. Slightly smaller than the G602 wireless mouse. I like the size of the G602 more, but the G502 is good enough. Weighs about the same as the G402, although the G502 comes with weights that I didn't use.

There are two buttons to the left of the left mouse button that change DPI. I used these to set the DPI to the same resolution as my G402. Didn't need to spend any time getting used to it.

The scroll wheel is somewhat different. Heavier than any the wheel on any other mouse I've used, and it's somewhat slippery. I've gotten used to it, but I'd prefer a regular scroll wheel.

There's a ""G"" logo on the mouse that by default fades from one color to another.

I didn't install any software."
Jeanine Sunshine,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","I love this mouse for how accurate it is and how you can easily change DPI. Perfect for FPS games and even for league. The metal spin wheel really doesn’t need the rubber like people are complaining about, it responds perfectly fine free or not. I have giant manly hands and it fits nicely. If I had a complaint it’s just that if I don’t have my hand positioned perfectly on the mouse, I bump the buttons by my thumb on accident a lot, so every time I play I need to think about how it’s positioned. You don’t really notice til it happens. The software it comes with it pretty intuitive and has a lot of options. Love how you can set everything for each different game you play so you don’t have to fumble to remember to change settings. I’ve been using Logitech gear since 2008, they haven’t let me down yet. Got the mouse on sale around Black Friday time for a great price, I couldn’t pass it up and I’m glad I didn’t."
MB,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2020",I have been using Logitech gaming mice for a long time. They always hold up pretty well over time and are build really well. I upgraded from a 500s which was great for the past 3 years of heavy use but finally started to have tracking issues. I never had an issue with the way it tracked being a Laser mouse but now that I have experienced this optical sensor on the 502se I don't think I will ever go back. Its SO smooth! Can't say enough about the tracking accuracy. Its the best I have experienced. All the buttons are very tactile and snappy. Left and Right click have a very short travel and extremely fast for FPS games. Love the mouse overall. The only two things I would say for people with smaller hands is that its not the shortest mouse from palm to fingertips. Its seems designed for larger hands. And the sniper button is a bit too far forward. I really wish it was about 1/4 inch back.
Alex,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2023",Side button (small one) was sticky at first and wouldn't register clicks that well. I thought it would be a problem but after playing with it a bit it started to work consistently... I don't know what that was all about but overall this gaming mouse is legit! I used the other G502 before and it was amazing (and didn't have side button issues). Overall I believe the G502 Hero mice to be the best on the market for competitive gaming.
Moses Sanchez,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2020","Ok when I went to look for a mouse online I went in blind and didn't look up any reviews and was mainly looking for wired products so here starts the review:
This mouse excel's my expectations which I'm glad it does but for people with big hands this might be of concern. So this mouse comes with weights which is a plus and Stickers, not needed but more swag and of course the mouse which you can program three top buttons (including left and right mouse clicks) and three in the side plus you can lock your scroll wheel on the fly so if I had any downsides to this mouse it be the size, even for a decently sized hand it is small mainly it's very narrow but after using it extensively I got used to it and still is a problem but not as glaring. So if there is anything you wish to take away from this review just not that this mouse is meant for medium to small hands not for huge hands."
Frostbite,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2022","This is one of the few mice I've owned in the past 10 years that hasn't started double clicking side buttons or main buttons in 6 months or less. Just for that at the sale price it was on, wonderful value. Fits my right hand like a glove and has a great sensor, never feel it spins out or jitters from my use. G-Hub software sucks compared to the old stuff Logitech uses and seems to want to brick my 502 so I've ignored the firmware updates. Get it together, Logitech. Stop using low quality switches in nearly everything while you're at it."
Alan,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","Pros:
+Nice and light (no weights)
+Availability of weights to fine tune it
+Multiple on-board profiles (preferable to using G-Hub)

Cons:
-G hub is not as intuitive as it could be, some things could be less buried

Other thoughts:
In my case, it seems that the primary button switches are going wonky. I find myself zooming in and out more than intended when playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint but other times I'll have no problems whatsoever. I haven't thoroughly tested the left click yet but I have experienced similar issues in the same game. Not so much in others.

Edit 7/16/2020:?Yeah, I'm definitely experiencing intermittent switch failure with the right mouse button. That kind of blows, I really like this mouse. For now I've set as many games to ""toggle aim"" as I can but I am definitely going to be shopping for a new one when I have the ability."
amxcoder,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020","This is the best mouse I have ever owned. I don't do gaming. I just do normal tasks plus video and photo editing. This mouse has programmable buttons and a feel I like a lot. I did not give it any stars for gaming because I don't do gaming. One of my favourite features on this mouse is the wheel. If you push the button next to it you get it to freewheel and one push of the wheel will go a very long way. If you don't want it to freewheel you just push the button again and you get clicks as you rotate the wheel. I admire the designer. The changing RGB colors on the mouse are wasted on me. My wife likes them. I can't think of any improvements they could do. Well, if it could read my mind about what I wanted to do and then execute those commands it would be better."
Shane,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020","I use palm grip and mostly drive with my wrist and I love this mouse. Fits my hand perfectly with my thumb resting on the most forward side button, but the other 2 are easy to reach as well. Not sure what size my hand is but I'm 5'11 and feel like I have average hands, maybe on the small side of average (can palm a mini bball, cant palm a full sized bball).

Infinitely scroll is very nice as well for web browsing or big excel sheets.

The rgb looks good but the software isnt great. It's not bad once you get the hang of it but could be a bit user friendly. I just set the buttons and haven't used it much besides that except to play with the rgb.

I went to BestBuy and got my hands on a big range of mice and liked this the best. Waited for a sale and pulled the trigger, no regrets."
Benjamin D. Alexander,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","Yes, I'm one of those oddballs your mom warned you about, a tip gripper!

My Daedalus 303 started double clicking randomly when I was single clicking, so I needed a new one. Well, those are out of production, so after doing a bunch of research, in many ways this mouse was the closest direct replacement in terms of features. Now having used it for number of months, I can say this unit is far more comfortable than the previous, with the same level of sensitivity.

I play all sorts of different types of game, FPS and MMO being the most prevalent, and it feels good in all the types I have tried. If you're a tip gripper, or a claw, I think you will really like this mouse. If you're into a palm grip, it's ok, but I'd recommend you look for something a little different, but it would still work well."
Ayaan,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020","The Logitech G502 is a really good mouse. I got it at a good price because it’s often on sale, and I believe it was worth every dollar. The programmable buttons make gaming more fun because now I don’t have to reach all the way across the keyboard, I can set far keybinds to the extra mouse buttons. The shape of the mouse fits my hand amazingly. I used to have a small cheap mouse that cramped my hand up but with the G502 i’ve experienced nothing but comfort. It doesn’t feel cheap either, it’s plastic but it feels like such a high quality material that won’t break anytime soon unless you’re trying to break it. The scroll wheel is metal which makes it feel kind of premium to use. Overall I’d highly recommend this mouse. It’s wired but if that’s not your style, Logitech offers a wireless one for a higher price."
J. Deernutz,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2023",I just use it as a regular mouse but the buttons on it make some stuff go faster and its super smooth
chesnutthouse,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022","after using this mouse for a couple years, I can say that it's definitely worth the money. I like a heavyweight mouse, so the optional extra weights are great for me. the high DPI limit is something I love, because I typically turn mine way up. The Thumb rest is nice as well, since when I had my old mouse, I got callus buildup on the side of my thumb. The braided cable is also great because you don't get those weird kinks like with a rubber coated one."
Michael,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020","I received this as my first logitech mouse to use. I had been using the razer deathadder elite, and the glorious model o- upon getting this one, I did not even bother adding any of the weights. Used it few days mainly playing fps games. All the craze of light weight mouse are the best for fps. Well I decided to add all the weights to try it out, maki g it quite heavy compared to the other ones I have always used. My accuracy was a lot better and I absolutely love the heavier feel with the weights even tho using it for fps cod and bf type games. I did disable the 2 buttons by the left click after accidentally hitting them in the heat of battle. This fits my hand perfect as I have short wide hand and the deathadder elite was just too long of a mouse compared to this one."
Rae,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020","This mouse was exactly what I was looking for, I wanted more buttons to use for my game (mmorpg) I've bound all buttons except left an right click giving me 9 actions vs the 2 I had on my previous mouse. The software was easy to learn and install. No disk is required just download from there site. I'm very pleased that it allows different profiles for different things. I have one for desktop use and as soon as I open my game the mouse automatically changes to the game specific setting. I used different color of the lighting to indicate what profile the mouse is in. I currently use the auto profiles which for me are desktop wow and Minecraft. I'm assuming it goes off the games downloaded so it would probably be different for someone else. But having it already know what different profiles I need was extremely useful. Overall I love this mouse and plan on getting another for my husband."
James Kuhns,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2022",I am very picky in my mouse. I have tried several different mouses and I just don't like the feel. After having my old logic tech mouse g500 for years I cried when it died. Now I have this g502 se I love it. Love it so much that I ordered a 2nd one. I recommend anyone looking for a good mouse to grab one of these you won't regret it.
Gorton,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2021","This is my second one I bought as a spare during black friday. I currently am still using my original and love it. The button layout, weight and ergos are very good.
The included software also makes mapping the buttons to keys normally not available is very handy. Be fun if it came in more colors...but not worried about it.
The adjustable DPI goes from very very slow...to breath on it and the mouse is on the other side of the screen...seems a bit much but I have it set and dont change it.
Being able to disconnect the scroll wheel from the clicker is an unrealized cool idea. If you are on a large document it can fly down the page....or you could use the slider I guess."
Carol Campbell,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2020","I've had this mouse for 8 months now with use almost every day, and I haven't had a single problem. It feels great in the hand, the buttons have endured, and the software is great. The one downside is the hefty weight of it (although when you have a mouse with 11 programmable buttons, I'm sure it's hard to get it much lighter). I play a lot of FPS's and the weight of it hasn't really made me less competitive. The biggest praises go to the build quality and the software. The matte finish on the plastic make finger prints non-existent, and the buttons are still clicky and responsive. The Logitech G Hub software is above and beyond any peripheral software I've seen. It makes this mouse so versatile and useful for gaming and productivity alike. I absolutely love this mouse, and, if this one breaks, I'll be replacing it with another g502."
Ari,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020","I am used to paying upwards of $75 for a gaming mouse but this one proves that is not necessary. My previous mouse was a G502 Proteus and it had seen a huge amount of use and was getting a little gross and the cable was fraying pretty badly. I looked up getting another one because it had a really good run when I discovered there was a new version for half the price without sacrificing any features and even had a better sensor I was sold. My hand is instantly at home on the Hero and everything feels exactly the same with a new more flexible cable that feels smoother and less likely to fray. The sensor seems smoother though it is difficult to tell because that could be from wear and dust on the Proteus. Anyway, 100% satisfied all around."
Lain,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020","This mouse, the Logitech G502 SE Hero, is at least a billion times better than the Logitech G403 Prodigy.
I was going to massively dislike Logitech mouses after having bought a used Logitech G403 Prodigy from Amazon from a seller in ""like new"" condition... but it was all scratched up and nasty. This is not only because the mouse was not in good condition, but also because the mouse itself was bad. The material of the G403 was prone to developing gunk, and the ""back"" button was so misplaced and prone to accidental presses constantly. Thankfully, this Logitech G502 SE Hero doesn't have any issues, and it goes above and beyond. I am really happy with this purchase of mine, especially when I thought I was completely doomed from there being no good mouse for around $30-40 (anything more than that, imo, is unnecessarily expensive). I am so happy this mouse; no more buyer's remorse and no more headaches. I highly recommend this."

Jesse Ward,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2021","This is just another variation of the classic G502(my 3rd in fact). One of my all time favorite mice! I now use a wireless mouse, but not a day goes by where I don't contemplate plugging in ""old faithful"" From the ergonomics, to the classic free spin scroll wheel. It has always felt like more of an extension of my hand, than an accessory. If you can catch it for under $30 on sale, it is arguably one of the best wired mice at that price point. The only downside would be the build quality, but if your not slamming it around it like a toddler you should be fine"
Daliari Fatinalle,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","This is second of these logictech mice I've bought after a year of the last one. The last one runs fine. Actually more then fine but my cat puked all over it and despite that it still works great. So I bought another and honestly I highly recommend it. As far as gaming it's got you covered its got a good weight to it, with and without the adjustable weights, and plenty of buttons. Also feels good to hold. If I had to get my brother a gift for his set up it would definitely be this mouse. The special addition is literally just wight stripes instead of black ones from what it looks like but it's still cool. Satisfying purchase"

Chris L,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2020","I ""upgraded"" to this from the G602, which is wireless. I was happy with the G602 until the connection started randomly stuttering at times, which is frustrating when playing fast-paced FPS's. The G502 SE Hero, besides not having any wireless connectivity issues, has much higher sensitivity (16,000 DPI vs. 3200 DPI) and double the report rate (1,000 vs. 500). The difference is definitely noticeable. Bring in the 5-way scroll wheel and customizable LED lighting for a cherry on top. And of course, it takes advantage of Logitech's software profiles, which allow custom button maps for different programs (that is, a profile for each game you play, another for graphics editing software, another for your video editor, etc), that automatically activate based on the program being used. This is certainly a good mouse for gamers."

The battery lasted a little while but got tired of having to re-charge my batteries. I saw this was on sale and figured I give it a try. Very comfortable mouse. The weight of the g502 mouse isn't an issue for me when gaming as it feels lighter than the g602 because of it being a wired mouse. The response time is excellent with no issues in my book. I liked the g502 so much i bought a second for my home computer. I even convinced a coworker to purchase one. Btw, it does have the ability to change the color of the logo which is an added feature."

I love the mouse, the features and the, function, but I would not order from this seller again. Mine was shipped from Seller: Value Stock. Hopefully when I return it nobody will receive it without at least being tested and cleaned next time..
UPDATE: Received a replacement from the seller, not sure how the mistake happened but I now have a ""like-new"" mouse and it is amazing. The customization of weight always sounded gimmicky to me but after testing a few different setups I have found my preference. The buttons all seem to function perfectly, though the front side button (They market it as dps shift but it is remapable). If you have big hands or long fingers, I highly recommend this mouse!"

jd,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2020","I've been using this mouse for several months now. I bought the black and white special edition only because it was cheaper than the regular version and I'm happy I did. The white looks good and looks good on the mouse.

This is a solid mouse. It seems well constructed and despite all the hatred on the mouse wheel, I like it. The wheel is heavy (seems to be a solid piece of aluminum) and scrolls easily. The buttons have a slight tactile click so I know they've been activated but aren't obnoxiously loud. The cable braid seem heavy enough to stand against a good amount of abuse.

Overall this really is a very good mouse for a very good price."
Chris Calvin,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2021",I bought this as my first gaming mouse. I was in the process of buying my first gaming pc at the same time. When I got the mouse it worked wonderfully. But then it started having issues. It wouldn't drag and drop properly then while playing a game and trying to shoot arrows it would shoot several arrows before actually firing a good shot even though I was holding down the mouse button the whole time. It got so bad that I have had to take it off my computer and use a cheap no name mouse for now till I can buy a new mouse.

The sensor is super responsible without being jittery, included weights make it so you can adjust the weight to something that feels great for you, as Id used a wireless mouse with 2 AA batteries inside I preffer mice with a bit of heft. The buttons on the mouse are all in pretty nice places and G hub makes it super easy to assign specific commands to easier to reach places. I'm not one for adjustable dpi or seperate profiles but the options for those are present and seem well implemented, better for me though the dpi and profile associated buttons can also be rebound! All in all, well worth the price"
Craig C.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020","The Logitech g502 is one of the best gaming mice on the market. I have had the Proteus core for quite a few years, and I have now upgraded to this one. They all are amazing and they keep getting better with each generation. New sensor is extremely smooth and very responsive. The tuning software from Logitech and very user-friendly and the customization is nearly Limitless. I found the tangle free branded cord on the Hero SE very premium feeling. My last g502 lasted over 5 years and is still going so I expect great things from this one. Would definitely recommend this product at its normal MSRP, but as I just got this one for $35, picking it up was a no-brainer."

I can no longer live without the left/right scroll wheel clicks for videos but they do wear out if you use them as much as I do. Or as accident prone, or plagued with as many sinister housepets as I am. No stars off bc every time I go to replace my mouse it's cheaper and better.
Came from a G700s to, well another G700s to a 502 Proteus to the Hero. The Hero sensor is great. I upped my personal DPI and speed by a thousand and am no less accurate in games. I should get another while they're cheap."

Bookm_danno,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","I'm not a dishonest person and I tell you as it is. I'll make a brief pro and con list for your convenience

Pros:
all the dpi necessary for your games
The scroll wheel has a free-roll mode, and a stutter-scroll.
clicks are tactile
9 programmable buttons.

cons:
(nothing too serious in all matters)
Dpi adjusting gets to be a chore after a while, but you get the hang of it soon enough
No ""fire"" button or a button that will do 2 left clicks at one press (which some budget mice do have)
The Logitech logo the flashes the rgb colors is hidden by your hand 90% of the time, not sure of the whole point of RBG when your hand is on it XD"
NNB,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021","i thought it would be worse than the already-awesome Logitech G502, as it is a bit cheaper (i do not know the exact price but whatever) but i was proven wrong as it is literally a G502 with white accents.

I would recommend this mouse to anyone, just not for FPS (first person shooter) games.

The mouse's bulkiness and weight (even though its customizable) just isn't ideal for clicking heads and flicking, but its all down to personal preference.

Verdict is that it has its ups and downs, but this is still a good mouse overall"

I love the fast scroll or controlled scroll feature too! This is the first time I've ever had a mouse of such quality!
I'd say the one downside is that you have to download the Logitech g hub to remap buttons as they are already preset to do things. Overall though, its a really nice product for the price, and once you figure everything out with a bit of research, an amazing mouse."

You can use this in games to have the dpi shift as you hold it and then return when you let go. Or for those like me, I use this mouse as a developer. I use the g-shift to basically allow we to switch to an alternate selection for the button. So with it held they do one action and when it’s not they do something else.

The amount of extra buttons is great. The scroll wheel is also awesome as it can become a free spinning wheel at the press of a button, it can become a great tool in certain games or an addicting fidget toy. Not to mention the build quality, which is really good. This is a really good mouse, highly recommended."
Fred Savage,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021","When I first got this I was coming from a Logitech G300s Optical Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse (also purchased on Amazon). That mouse felt great but I would have issues when holding the Left Mouse Button in a game and having it treat it like I had let go and re-clicked. I haven't had that issue with this mouse. The only thing I disliked was the mouse felt weird at first after coming from the G300s but now, 1.5 months after purchase, it feels great. No issues for any of the games I play."
Jeff S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2021",This mouse has a few great features. One is the scroll can be set to free scroll so there's no resistance or tactile feedback which is nice if you have pain in your wrist or hands. Also the software is very easy to use to create your own hotkeys and even macros on any of the buttons. The scroll wheel clicks left and right too for additional inputs. I have copy/paste on the left and right scroll wheel and back/forward on the thumb cluster buttons. Best mouse I've ever had.

Reemy,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2022","I work in DevOps, and being able to hotkey copy and paste to some of these buttons ends up saving me a lot of things me and effort. It might not seem like much, but it speeds up my ability to work greatly."
Blaine,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019","I bought this as a gift for my husband, who is very involved with gaming and technology. He loves the placement, versatility, and number of buttons. He uses this on a cloth mousepad, and says there is no drag, and he is able to rest his hand comfortably on the mouse without his pinky touching the mousepad. I noticed some negative reviews about the scroll wheel before purchasing, and the scroll wheel does free spin, but it also has ridges. Neither of us have had a problem with it spinning when we didn't need it to or having any trouble with it. It has ridges as pictured."
Nick Lucarelli,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","I was getting tired of constantly having to replace $20-30 gaming mice and decided to take it a step up in quality. I was not disappointed in the least, this mouse is the smoothest one I’ve ever used. The extra buttons are very useful for bindings and the software is very easy to install and use, nothing difficult about it. You can customize the weight of the mouse as well, which I find very handy if you have a preferred weight you like your mouse to be at. I highly recommend investing in this mouse, it’s got the biggest bang for the buck as far as I’ve seen."
Eric Johnisee,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2023",I bought 2 of these for my boys. Both of my sons were very happy with these. They love the adjustable weights which make this feel much more substantial. Going to be buying one for myself as well.
Vang,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2019","It was this or the corsair harpoon, my husband end up loving and I never got the chance to try it. (Sad face) He likes the weight of the mouse, he also said that he saw a different while playing modern warfare. (Notsure because he still die but end up first place?) No problem with the scrolling thing nor the program for the mouse yet, will update if any issue arise. Oh, I end up getting the corsair, keep in mind they are completely different mouse so do your research.

UPDATE: After a few months of using it. I too have experienced the double clicking on this mouse.."
Saood D.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2020",This is my second G502 mouse. Not because the old one broke or anything but because it’s such a great mouse. The cable is braided so it won’t drag or even get caught. The lights in the mouse are RGB. DPI switch is really nice to have along with its display. Scroll wheel has 2 settings. Different profiles can be set up. Super handy to have the page back and page forward buttons on the mouse. Includes weights to change how the mouse feels. Very little sliding resistance. Overall great product
April,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021","Works great so far. Ever since COVID I’ve been alternating days at home and in the office, and it’s made me realize that the gaming mouse I have at home is actually really fantastic for Excel as well. Particularly the Hyperscroll button! The shape and button layout of this one will take a bit of getting used to compared with my older G500, but I like that this model also includes weights so it feels nice and solid in my hand. Plus, great price."
Scott Stevens,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2022","I love this mouse and have one for all of my computers, gaming and business. I love that I can programs the buttons both for gaming and for common functions on my business computers. Logitech has always been a favorite and they never disappoint."
Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2020","I bought this because numerous (even one or two reputable) sites list this as one of the best mice of 2019, and for good reason. The software works and the tracking is excellent.

My only complaints are that the scroll wheel over tracks a little when the locking switch is off and the bottom plate, that houses the weights, does not click into place, it uses a bit of suction to stay in place- I am a little uneasy about it but it is working for now. No points docked as the design is great and these are minor issues for the price point."
Rolland M. Weber,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020","Using this mouse mainly for GTA V and 7 Days to Die. Very quick response, no apparent lag and buttons in comfortable locations. The adjustable weights can be a little fiddly to get in place, but they make a lot of difference in the overall feel of this mouse. The mouse wheel has a button that lets it spin freely or click which is great for papers or long essays involving multiple pages and the software allows a lot of options to make this thing do just about anything you want it to. Overall, absolutely worth the money."
Rooster,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2022",i love these mouse just had the black hero give up on me after 2years from smashing and being aggressive would always recommend this mouse to folks that need a reliable and cheap mouse
