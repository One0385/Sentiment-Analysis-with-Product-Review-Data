Buttt I dont why my mouse led only light up one line.... I think it is broken ... shittt...to be a good customer I still give 5stats la"
Metheldis R.,5,31 Jan 2024,"cheapest price for the item..superbly fast drop off and delivery..ok packaging,only bubblewrapped plastic..item is genuine as i managed to registered my S/N at Logitech website..item is great for gaming,especially for huge right handed gamers..all buttons feel solid..DPI is ridiculously high..adjustable weight..side scroll and scroll buttons..free scroll toggle..hold to precise/low DPI function..both up and down DPI stage buttons..fully customisable chroma lighting..the only downfall is the Ghub is kinda hassle to download for older windows version,and i’m using Win8,PS: use Edge to download older version via their website..that’s all..highly recommended..easy 5 stars..kudos 💪"
Jeff T.,5,10 Mar 2021,"I was skeptical to buy from this store as it has zero review on all products. Decided to be the first customer since the response on the chat is fast and very helpful, even during weekend. Items received within a few days, everything work perfectly as per advitised. There are 11 programmable buttons and this has certainly help to increase my productivity, such as copy paste, show desktop, open new tab close tab etc. And the 25k DPI is just lighting fast. Thank you for the freebie, love it."

daniel J.,5,23 hours ago,I've been using it for a week now and find it better than my previous logitech mouse. Hopefully this one will last longer.  
MT L.,5,4 weeks ago,Packing took some time due to 5.5 sale but delivery was fast. The box is quite dented even though bubble wrapped. Nonetheless the mouse is in perfect condition. It has adjustable weights for personalized balance and ergonomic design for comfortable grip. 
Evelyn L.,5,4 weeks ago,"Even though it was bubble-wrapped, the box was torn. And the plastic that the mouse was in was slightly opened and not sealed.  This is the condition of box and insides after opening the bubble wrapping. Therefore, it was not due to delivery but the original state as it was wrapped over. Makes you wonder whether this was a returned product and sold as new. After paying so much, wish the condition that the mouse came in was mint.

However, it works as advertised. But my mind is not at ease. And it is too troublesome to ask for a replacement.  "

Maisarah S.,5,22 Dec 2021,"The mouse is great! The form factor, weight, the easy customisation, it’s simply perfect. I only have a few minor issues, the button placement. My hands are a bit small so it’s a bit uncomfortable. Upgrading from the G300S, I’m used to having extra buttons on each sides. For the G502, they’re all on the left side so I need time to get used to it. Would highly recommend!"

Z***.,5,24 Jan 2024,"Functionality:Lots of DPI settings to choose from with programmable buttons for gaming and macro commands for software like Adobe Photoshop.

 Quality:Somewhat average. The scroll wheel has a plasticky finish and the mouse doesn't have stress relief guards for the cord

 Material:High quality plastic. Too light for my liking despite the supplied iron weights.

I bought the G502 Hero on a whim without due diligence on my part as my old Corsair M65 corded gaming mouse stopped working after 7 years. I'm not familiar with the Logitech G series mice and chose one that looked good but affordable.

While this mouse has optional weights, they're all positioned from the center towards the back. Unlike the Corsair M65 there's no provision for adding weights in front therefore the weight distribution is rear heavy.

On the plus side the G502 Hero's scroll wheel is quite sensitive and needs only a light touch. There is no surface calibration feature for this model for some particular reason.

This is a mouse that I find easy to adapt for normal use but it's not quite what I had hoped for FPS gaming.  "

Ho Y.,5,2 days ago,"Been using for a week now, upgraded from a G402. Pros: fits my hand well but YMMV. The side buttons are wider than 402 so its more natural to press. Can toggle smooth/stepped mouse wheel. LR mouse wheel buttons are cray. Feel delighted to come back to it. 
Cons: heavy for a modern mouse at 100+g, then they give more weights. Sometimes GHub doesnt detect my game. 

Wish they still did the above-mouse-wheel button like the MX512.  "

Muhammad H.,5,24 Jun 2021,Skeptical between G502 and G402 so yolo'd this; Worth it. All the buttons are great it feels nice for M to L hands. It looks nice and doesn't interfere with handling. The 3.6g weights to make the mouse heavier is a nice touch for those that like high DPI but want more control on it. If you can get discounts on G502 then get it. Shipment is okay its FMCO still a respectable time. The handling of the product is typical of Logitech ;good care of product. 
Reuben S.,5,23 Jun 2021,"A decent gaming mice, with good sensitivity at the buttons. Adjustable weights gives a solid feel for individual tastes. Scroll lock button gives different options for scroll wheel. DPI clutch allows immediate switch to different DPI as set in GHub.
