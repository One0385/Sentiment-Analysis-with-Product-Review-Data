Bront,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2024","I've been a long time user of the G602 and G604, but both were heavy, and the 604 replaced the 602, and has since been discontinued and not replaced. So after searching for mice with extra buttons near the thumb but also comfortable with a lot of the features I've loved in the 604. While the G502 X didn't fill all those needs, it's been a great choice.

Pros:
- Ergonomic - It just fits my (rather large) hand well in a few different positions, and is so light I've found my wrist fatigue has been reduced significantly. Unlike the 604, I can press every button easily without looking for them, particularly the scroll wheel, DPI adjustments, and 3 easy to find thumb buttons is great. It also feels comfortable, which is hard to describe, but the material feel is what I want in a mouse.
- Light - I mentioned this in the ergonomic part, but its super light. Apparently it's around 105 grams, which can be heavy for an ultra-competitive mouse, but for most gamers or folks just looking for a light wireless mouse, it's great.
- Great button feel - The older Logitech mice used to have a weird mushy click and my old 602 and 604 both had issues where the button would stop working well. The new G502 X models have a new mechanical click that feels amazing. Very much like a mechanical keyboard as far as consistancy and feedback. Not every button has the same feel, but they all feel very tactile and reliable.
- Great battery life - I can get 3 weeks on a full charge at 1000 hz poling rate. Don't bother with smaller polling rates, as when the mouse isn't being used it's not a power issue, and when it is in use, it's still not a huge power issue. You might get a few extra days at best, but if 3 weeks isn't enough charge time for you, I'd be shocked.
- USB-C charging - Sad that this is still a plus, but USB-C cables are so much better. Glad we're finally starting to no longer see Micro-USB cables.
- Works Wired - Forgot to charge it? You can use it wired, or use it while charging (Either works).
- Great sensitivity - The mouse is so adjustable, I found I could turn it down from my usual DPI and get both great responsiveness and accuracy with a near default config.
- Customizable - Logitech G software has flaws, but it does allow some pretty good versatile configurations. Every button can be remapped and remapping can be done on a per-app basis.
- Logitech Support - I've had multiple issues with Logitech mice long into their service but under warranty, and Logitech has always been easy to work with to get a replacement or help. This sounds like I'm saying Logitech has a quality issue, and I'm not, I know stuff happens, particularly with high use products, so it's good they stand by them.

Cons:
- Large - It's not a small mouse, so if you have small hands, it could be a little large for you. It also means it's not easily portable, though honestly mice aren't that large in general, so portability isn't a major concern, and you can always get a mouse case if you travel a lot and want to protect it.
- Logitech G Software sucks - I mean, it does OK, it can auto-sense games, you can copy profiles, but it has several general flaws, including if it detects a new game it generates that game's default setting that you CAN NOT CUSTOMIZE ahead of time. If I have a known default mapping/DPI setting I know I like in most games, why can't I make that the default? Also, making button changes and navigation of the US is very unintuitive. Like one of the worst UIs I've worked with on a major brand's software. It also by default likes to spam notifications that is harder to turn off than I would have liked (Otherwise, every time the mouse gets touched, you get a windows notification or 3 about the mouse and DPI changes). Their old software (pre 2015) was easy to use, and worked in the UI was nearly the exact opposite of this. Fix your software Logitech!
- No backup gliders - Not a deal breaker, as I know I've not had a mouse with glider issues in the past 10-15 years, but it would be nice, particularly on a gaming mouse where if the pads wear it could be noticeable for some. I don't need stickers Logitech, I'd rather have a replacement pad set.
- No pinkie rest - Some mice have a nice pinkie rest that helps you relax your hand a bit. This mouse does not. That's definitely a personal thing, and honestly most gaming mice have moved away from this due to weight, but with a large hand, I like mice with them.

Overall, it's a great mouse with a lot going for it. I'm enjoying using it, have found my hand/arm feel better after a day of using it vs my old mouse, and love all the features it offers that I can look past any small shortcomings.

Who do I recommend this mouse for? Artists who need finite DPI control. Office workers who want a bigger mouse (there are cheaper options, but it's a solid productivity mouse). People who use their computer for a significant time. Casual gamers. Competitive gamers who want an all in one mouse. It's a good mouse for a lot of use cases, which is why I'm giving it a 5 star review. It's not perfect, but very few products are, and it's strong where it needs to be."
John,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2024","This is an excellent mouse. It might not be the absolute best mouse for competitive gaming, but it still performs very well. Rtings ranks this as the ""best wired mouse"" which it absolutely deserves. Tracking is excellent and the ergonomics are great. The rubber grips are nicer and don't wear out quickly like my G403/G703 did. Given that it uses optical switches, I expect it to not start double-clicking like all my other Logitech mice, but we'll see about that.

The best part about it is the amount of buttons and general utility it provides for non-gaming tasks. The scroll wheel unlocks and can spin at high speeds, and it can tilt left and right for horizontal scrolling. You have three thumb buttons, two extra buttons next to the left mouse button, and a middle button below the scroll wheel toggle. All of the buttons can be rebound, and you can also have an extra ""layer"" of buttons that can be switched to when a specific button is held (I use the ""sniper"" button for this). This means you get a ton of easily-accessible shortcuts which makes navigating web pages or documents very convenient.

Only two possible downsides to consider: it's wired, but the cable is very thin and light, and not having to charge ever is a big plus. There's also no RGB, which isn't a deal-breaker for me but some might find it disappointing."
Barn & Field,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2023","For about the last decade I’ve used the same mouse, a Logitech G502 Proteus Core, this mouse’s great great great grandparent. In that time I became accustomed to the particular shape and feel of this mouse, the incredibly intuitive placement of extra buttons, and the surprisingly decent software (which has had its ups and downs over the years but has consistently remained functional for me).

I previously avoided upgrades to the G502 Proteus Core because it did everything I needed from a mouse, never broke, never needed a new battery, and was rock solid reliable over USB. But recently I started wondering again if wireless mouse technology had advanced enough to make it competitive with wired.

Enter the G502X Lightspeed, my first wireless mouse in over a decade. Overall I like this mouse more than my Proteus Core. The wireless tech has been almost perfectly reliable for me. The only issue I have with it vs a wired variant is that it takes a second to adjust to its settings after waking up from sleep. I’ve had zero dropped inputs or noticeable lag. In this sense, it has been as reliable as I expect a mouse to be and really confirmed the strides there have been in wireless technology. The lack of RGB lights is a welcome change for me. I always kept the blue lighting disabled on my Proteus Core, so to not have any unlit light spots or lighting settings to deal with has been nice for me. Battery life has been great. I use this mouse for about 12 hours a day between work and personal computers and get about 3 weeks between charges. I doubt the battery will let this last as long as my Proteus Core before it needs to be serviced or replaced, but for the benefits of no cord drag, I’m willing to accept that I think. The clicks are a little more hollow-sounding than on the original, but seem to be just as or more accurate. I prefer a heavier mouse, so I slightly miss the heft of the Proteus Core, but I’ve quickly adjusted to the pleasant weight of this mouse which is still a bit heavier than many of its competitors. The slight change in shape is better for my hand and typical palm grip, I can feel the improvement in my ability to reach buttons and in day-long use comfort. The scroll wheel isn’t as substantial, but it still offers a very pleasant endless scroll and a tactile locked scroll feeling.

This mouse is a worthy successor to the Proteus Core throne and it does so many things right that its trade-offs are worth it to me. The G502 line continues to be my favorite way to interact with a computer, and I’m glad to see Logitech continuing to improve and commit resources to this great series of mice."
Alex A,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024","First of all the mouse looks absolutely amazing.
It works just fine with the POWERPLAY charging mousepad.
The clicking feels super nice, and I’m very happy with it.
I have have 0 issues with the tracking on the mouse. It does exactly what you need to do in terms of cursor tracking and customizability via the GHub App.
It seems very durable considering my old mouse was the 502 wireless (original wireless) and it still holds up. I just bought this one because it looked really cool and had better specs overall.
It’s very easy to use and super easy to get into if you have had the old G502. It’s a bit lighter as well and does not include magnets.
Get this product !"
Abhishekh Reddy,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2022","Before buying this mouse, I was a G402 user since 2015 and as most button switches including the primary ones reached EOL. I was definitely sure that my next upgrade's gonna be the renowned G502 series.

I was very excited when Logitech announced the new G502X but due to the pricing, I wanted to try the older G502 Hero first when it went on sale at $35 recently. The G502 Hero felt pretty similar to G402 in terms of ergonomics with small improvements in accessibility of side buttons. But I felt the mouse was heavy even without the weights and didn't like the metal scroll wheel. Even the RGB fun faded off just after a few hours and honestly found it distracting. (After 3 days of using).

So I wanted to try the wired G502X as well and decided to return one of them at the end. After trying out the G502X, I felt the improvements addressed every shortcoming G502 Hero and G402 did for me.

The new shape offers much better support to the left part of palm (Just below index finger) with some increased height there. The DPI shift button, the side buttons, especially the ones next to left click felt even more accessible and practical to use them more than ever before. The new switches feel more clicky, tactile and satisfying but needs a bit more effort to click. Should see how long these switch will last in the long run.

The lightened scroll wheel with rubber grip feels more mature, the feel of ratcheted mode is lighter yet snappy and satisfying. Can assign custom scroll functions. And the overall aesthetic feels really mature and evolved, ready for the future.

I usually have a mixture of palm and finger grip and the mouse perfectly fits in with the improvement in right part of the palm (Just below index finger) support and quickly got used to the feel of mouse (Usually a few minutes of break-in time). The skates are much larger and a huge step-up. The mouse glides much smoother which complements well with the lighter weight of mouse (Lighter than both G402 and G502 hero).

But also, the wired G502X is expensive, no RGB but most notably the cable is a bit worrisome. I still would prefer the wired version just for the years of life one can squeeze out without worrying about battery wear.

Finally, I returned the G502 Hero and am gonna use the G502X for the coming years. Despite the price, I don't regret it. It's an agile mouse with a ton of functionality. If you are upgrading from an older mouse like me or a lower-end/basic one, go directly for this. But if you're already happy with the older G502/similar, need for this mouse is much weaker and it's up to you.

Thank you for reading so far. Happy holidays!"
namco,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","Backstory. I have been a gamer my whole life. I am currently as of writing this 34 years old. Yeah not a youngin but not an old man either.... I grew up using OG computers with ball mice. Over the years I had gotten a good feel on what makes a good mouse ""in my opinion"" and sadly many mice do not fit the bill. Many will SEEM to fit, only to fail later.

My very last mouse was the Razer Viper V2 Pro. And what a freaking mistake that was. I swear I have the worst time with mice. I use my computer at least 8 hours a day mix gaming and non gaming. I had given up on Razer for along time, trying off brands, chinese brands, and so on. But, I wanted a wireless mouse, so I gave Razer a chance. FIVE (5) months after use, the wireless side of the V2 Pro just stopped working for no reason. Legit would not connect. Tried multiple computers, over 20 different usb ports and hubs, it was just dead. Googled the issue and sure enough its a ""common"" issue and everyone with said issue ends up buying a new mouse as replacement. WHAT? I am not going to buy ""another"" Razer of the same model when it freaking failed. Why, so it can fail again in 5 months? I feel bad for people who keep giving these companies with bad practices money.

Turn around and I finally ordered this Logitech. EVEN Logitech, I had sworn ""to never use"" because they kept failing in terms of left click. They ALL have the same issue, double click error after long use. You can google that too and find many people complaining of double clicking ""but Logitech has the best wifi connection so no other brand can compare"" thus ""they still buy Logitech."" So like Razer, I decided to give them a second chance.... This time around, Logitech has given us optical switches, which IN THEORY should never fail in terms of double clicking.... So here I am, using it.

Firstly the mouse movement feel 1:1 vs what I see on screen. No I don't mean DPI wise. YES, 1200 DPI on this Logitech feels COMPLETELY different than 1200 DPI on the Razer I was using before it. But I dare say this G502 X Lightspeed is more ""accurate"" and ""stable."" No matter how fast or slow I move the mouse, the cursor tracks properly and moves the proper amount you expect. Razer was only ""slightly"" worse in this regards where sometimes you felt like ""I didn't aim there"" when moving. It didn't happen often, not as often as 3rd party cheap Chinese mice that's for sure. My go to mouse for a long time was Cooler Master brand, Spawn, Xornet 2, MM720.... I like the wider mouse as I have ""bear paw"" hands (wide hands with short fingers). But those mice have tracking issues. You move fast and the rate at which the mouse moves is different then when you move it slower. And its a huge variation between each speed you move the mouse. Its bad. This G502 X LS is the first to feel accurate like OG mice from back in the day, like the classic Microsoft Intellimouse which was my go to back in the 2000's....

The battery life is insane. The razer I would need to charge just about once a week. So far my Logitech seems to ""last forever."" I ended up buying one of those Soarking Charging Docks for the Logitech mice. Comes with the little POG bottom cover that allows for mounting/charging. And its magnetic. Every once in awhile I just toss it onto that charger while I sleep. I don't really think of it as ""charging"" because it charges while the PC is literally turned off. Which is a huge plus. You could argue ""that's why its lasting longer"" but ""out of the box"" the initial charge lasted me TWO WEEKS before the mouse shut off on me. THAT was when I bought the charging dock.... still two weeks vs one week on the razer is double the time....

The only downside is that the left and right click feel, mushy? its a short distance and the click feels, well it feels weird. It doesn't feel like a click, more like a ""clock"" feel. Its hard to explain really. Its not BAD per say, but I like the feedback of other mice where the click feels like an actual click. Mushy is the only way I can explain it. Its still a sharp feeling but mushy at the same time. I'm not good at explaining it.... again its not bad.

The scroll wheel also feels janky. I don't understand the ""free wheel"" scroll feature. Why? And when its in the click style turn mode, the ""notchy"" feel, it feels, mushy. I have to say my favorite mouse wheel has been Cooler Master mice. MM720 for example. Best mouse wheel on the market in my opinion.

IF I HAVE TO, I will come back an edit my review if something goes wrong. For now ive been using this mouse for over a months, 8 hours a day minimum, and its been flawless for now.

On an off note, my DREAM mouse would be Cooler Master optical buttons, Cooler Master scroll wheel, Logitech Wireless technology, Logitech Sensor, and shape can just have multiple shapes to please everyone, a normal one, an ergonomic one that has a high hump, a wide one like my fav CM mice. That mouse would be the mouse to end all mice in my opinion."
Hoai N.,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2022","I have some prior logitech mouse over the year like g300 (so many of them like one every 6-12month), g700 and others. Didn't have prior experience with the g502 hero and was always a fan of the 4 top button so I later transition to roccat tyon which is a bit larger and heavier (130gish) mouse that is d/c now. So this would mainly be my baseline comparison.

I been debating between all three version and didn't want to cough up money for powerplay as well for the RBG version so got the wireless non-RGB one. The old g502 lightspeed (non-x) wireless version was going for $80 but mechanical button (not optic) and was more in my price range. The wired version had cheap rubber wire that apparently rubbed against the mouse pad. I have been mostly in the ""wired"" club cause of latency and battery concern before. Going to transition to wireless club now.

Pro:
- 144 hours per ghub which is amazing which is 6 full days. If I use it 8hrs a day, that 18 days before I have to recharged. Usage is more close to 3hr on weekday and 12 on weekend so it should last a month for me. RGB version is like 30ish hours and that was my deciding factor w/o powerplay.
- Apparently only takes ~2 hour to charge to full
- Love the wireless, pretty much no lag at all with the dongle. Simply plug and play, and ghub software download via google.
- Many keybinding. I have like 18 keybinding by utilizing the G-shift key (bind it to the DPI+shift button) for office work profile. This is similar to the roccat easy shift which was by the thumb rest.
- USB-C charging. Did not even use the dongle extension hub. Will just use my android super charger next to my PC every
-25K DPI but who really would use this? I try to set my window sensitivity to lowest with 25k and that not happening. Rolling at window sensitivity 6 with 5500 DPI and 4 other DPI level for shifting.
-1000Hz Polling
-106g weight or so per description. Felt nice and it is gliding on my old logitech mousepad with those new white padding.
-Battery LED in center front of mouse. Can keybind to activate the battery level color.

Con:
- Coming from the roccat tyon, it was a bit smaller for me and had hand discomfort. Hoping to adjust soon.
-Scroll wheel (non-release): a bit louder for personal preference. Like if I'm scrolling down a page, it would go through like 3-4 of the tactile clicks. End up changing mouse setting to increase # of line per scroll to like 20.
-Scroll wheel (infinite scroll): I always loved this when I had the g700. This one, is nice for web page scrolling initially but as my finger tend to be on the scroll wheel, everytime that I stop, the page would scroll up a bit then back down again which is annoying.

-Keybinded new tab / close tab with scroll left and right. Problem is that, the function is ctrl+T / ctrl+W. This ctrl button + scroll wheel = zoom in/out. As I often navigate through many tab at once, it would occasionally perform unwanted zooming.

Neutral
-Would like to have button on the top right side as well.
-No RGB but I wasn't going pay like $15 extra for that plus your hand would cover like 90% of the light area.
-Still not getting use to the mouse click. With the new optic switch, it supposedly will prevent ""double-clicking"" issue. Either I am clicking it too lightly and I do get the feeling of ""I did double click, but it not opening"" since the file is clearly highlighted. Cause it is a bit smaller to my previous mouse, I notice I'm doing more of a claw grip instead of palm grip so my finger are pressing around 3/5 way of the button so this may be the reason.
- Content of box: Mouse, USB cable, dongle, dongle extender, DPI shift button cover and bunch of user guide.
-I feel like I got cheated a bit as it seems like I may have gotten a new returned and opened boxes. There was no plastic wrap and the box was inside a heatsealed plastic bag and the bottom of the mouse was a bit dusty which came off. I was still impress with the mouse so going ignore the hassle of returning and will be keeping it.

Overall: Definitely worth it to get the wireless non-RGB version for me. If you have powerplay then the RGB version may be for you if you want lighting."
J.S.,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022","The 2022 Logitech G502 X Plus was a very pleasant surprise. It is replacing a Logitech G-Pro that is roughly 80 grams weight on a Logitech Powerplay mouse pad (expanded cover for extra space and non-stop charging), primarily used for Overwatch2. Other gaming mice in my collection include earlier G502's, G903, Razer Death Adder + Copperhead, Steelseries Rival3 and Rival600, etc. Generally the best performers in FPS games are the lightest units with the best optical sensors, and the G502 X Plus definitely fits that criteria.

Pros:
-Comfortable ergonomic shape for marathon gaming sessions
-PTFE mouse feet for super-smooth glide across mouse pads
-The new optical hybrid switches are incredibly fast compared to the G-Pro's older Omron switches, with a nice crisp click and improved actuation. They will last much longer than conventional mechanical switches and correct double-clicking issues. My last G-Pro's right rear thumb switch suffered from double-clicking issues since they were the old Omron mechanicals that wore out from constant use.
-Nice RGB lighting if you are looking for that kind of bling
-This mouse wakes from sleep mode instantly (like the G-Pro series). The old G502 Hero Wireless required a full second to wake up, making the old sleep mode feature extremely inconvenient and annoying.
-At 106 grams list weight, the G502 X Plus is a tad heavier for a gaming mouse. However, coming from an 80 gram G-Pro, I notice better aim stability without sacrificing flick aim consistency. With the Powerplay charging puck attached and USB receiver stored inside, the G502 X Plus hits 110g on my postal scale. The G502 Hero wireless is 120g with the same accessories.

Cons:
-No more adjustable weights like its predecessor G502, but to be fair, the whole e-sport industry has shifted competitive user demand to lighter weight mice for the fastest aim flicks possible.
-Battery power drains faster with RGB lighting at full settings. This is mitigated by reducing RBG brightness to 85% and shortening idle-mode entry from 2 minutes down to 1. Using a Logitech Powerplay mouse pad, my mouse battery power hovers around 78% to 90% steady with RGB enabled.
-The mouse's black finish tends to have shiny oil stains and wear marks over time. This is why I apply blue painter's tape to the areas most prone to this issue. EDIT Feb 2024 - I've replaced the blue painter's tape with automotive carbon fiber vinyl wrap for better visual appeal. Not recommended if you do not like the feel of textured carbon fiber, but it definitely gets rid of those shiny oil stains. Picture attached.
-GHub software will not allow users less than 3 DPI presets, and all of these have to be different values at 50dpi intervals. I tried to ""lock"" my mouse at 1000dpi to avoid accidental DPI switching, but the software would not allow me to do this, so I ended up moving my DPI cycling button to the default profile button up top and removing the up/down DPI adjustment buttons next to the left click. This gave me two additional buttons for other programable functions (like Alt and middle-mouse click since pressing the mouse wheel down can feel awkward).
-The new hybrid mechanical switches have a different click sound compared to conventional switches -- not really louder, but definitely more metallic.

Yes, this mouse is expensive, but the combination of lighter weight + excellent ergonomics + fast/crisp long-wear switches makes this model very hard to beat. If you are looking for a mouse with more weight and heft, then you may not be happy with the G502 X since the latest model has been redesigned for the e-sports crowd. The G502 X now combines lighter weight with an ergo shape, something that most ultra-light mouse offerings lack.

NOTE: If you want the best wireless mouse experience, I recommend pairing the G502 X Plus with a Logitech Powerplay for non-stop wireless charging while using the mouse. For those that want a larger mouse pad than what the default Powerplay size offers, check out ""Logitech powerplay mousepad expansion mod"" on youtube. I have my set-up displayed in the attached images along with actual weight compared to the old G502 Wireless. Update 4/26/2023: The Glorious XL mousepad is the perfect thickness for this Powerplay expansion mod.

EDIT: I just read a few other reviews claiming that the G502 X feels ""cheap"" because it feels too light. The whole point of lowering mouse weight is to minimize mass, thereby requiring less physical energy / effort to move the mouse quickly and accurately. This is how modern e-sports mice are designed, because a lighter mouse is a faster mouse, while a heavier one is a slower boat anchor that is usually on the losing end of an FPS fire fight. The G502 X Plus is only 10 grams lighter than the G502 hero, yet it is much easier to flick-aim than the older G502 Hero Wireless.

Also, if you want RGB on the G502 X, you have to get the Plus edition, other wise you get no RGB. Yet one newer review complained about missing RGB LED's on his G502 X non-Plus edition. Going no-RGB is still a valid choice since it saves a few grams, extends battery life, and costs less, but just make sure you know what you are buying ahead of time. ;)"
uwuru,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","It's almost perfect so far. Even though it comes down to preference, I think this is one of the prettiest if not THE prettiest mouse out there while not being over the top, and it feels really great to use. It has tons of buttons, which can be a bit of a hassle (I've found myself pressing the scroll wheel buttons a ton accidentally) but hasn't really caused any issues, and you can configure them in the Logitech software so at least there's that. Speaking of the software, it's been really easy to just intuitively use without having to really read anything at all, though the notifications get a bit annoying. (you can them off)

Overall, its really, really good, but the main problem I find myself with is the battery life. It lasts me a few days before having to charge, and it's just annoying to have a wire running. Thankfully, there is something in the box that lets you connect both cables, and it basically lets you swap between the two really quickly while also allowing you to hide the wire when you don't need to charge; still pretty annoying, but it's good enough for me."
D. Goolsby,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024","Upgraded from my old G502 Proteus to the 502X Plus. It's nice to be wireless again. It feels like the same old mouse, but has a few minor changes. The main 2 buttons have a sort of hollow sound to them that I'm not crazy about, but I don't notice after a while. (it must be something to do with opto-mechanial switches, the switches on my newish Corsair K100 kb have a hollow sound too).

One potential is the infamous ghub software. I didn't like it when I tried it a few years ago. This time, I'm having no issues with it at all so I can't hate on it.

If you're wondering if you should pay extra for the RBG, YES! (as long as you like RGB). This looks so good in person and the ghub gives you some nice customization. Admittedly, the price difference between the Plus and non-Plus seems a bit steep, but if you're not in a hurry, wait until a sale. (which really you should anyway). When the G502X goes on sale, I find the price difference between the 2 version narrows down, so at least you won't think that you spent a lot for just RGB."
Kyle,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024","The legacy G502 was a favorite of mine and in service for years on years.

I was a little wary because mouse manufacturers have been finicky for a few years, using switches with substandard lifetimes and accumulating double clicks and other unhelpful quirks.

While I haven't used this long enough to know for certain if its longterm reliability will meet or exceed my original G502, it's comfortable and the Powerplay functionality works well. It usually idles at 70-80% battery capacity, which leads me to believe that it's kept intentionally at that threshold to preserve the battery's lifespan.

If I remember correctly, this model has optical switches which should alleviate some of the problems in earlier generations and prevent the notorious double click from lesser switches.

Overall, it's comfortable and well made, and I hope it lives up to the expense and expectations."
Brian,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024","My use case for this mouse is a odd use case. I primarily use this for corporate work from home, and I can't download any additional non work software onto the computer. I tried the newest MX Master Series, and I loved it but I couldn't use the software. I've tried the Razer ergo line mouse, was white and got gross immediately. This mouse is the number one selling mouse for a reason. Ergonomics is great, the amount of buttons is phenomenal, the onboard memory is a great addition, can add additional weights if need be, and is wired. While I won't be using this in office due to the sound, as a work from home mouse it's the best mouse I've used to date"
Rafa,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024","Bought this mouse to replace my struggling G502 Hero. Myself, as a lot of people, really like the shape of the G502 and the extra programmable buttons compared to other mouses on the market. The only downside of the G502 is that it weighs A TON, like 108g, which compared to this might not seem like a lot of difference, but i can certainly feel it. I guess the RGB was the sacrifice that needed to be made . 😢 I really like the white look, although the cable doesnt look or feel that good. Wish they had it braided. 😪 Definitely good value for your money though."
chris,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2024","I wanted to try the logitech G502 series mouses for a long time. I used to use the razor doppleganger for a while before it stopped functioning. So far this mouse has been solid. All the buttons feel sturdy, the RGB looks incredible. The response while gaming has been excellent and the connectivity hasn't given me any issues. Now with daily use I'd say this mouse lasts you about a week before you need to charge it. I haven't tried the wireless charging, so can't speak on that, but so far everything on the mouse has been excellent."
Mikey,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024","This mouse is undoubtedly the finest I have ever used. The buttons' clickiness is impeccable, and the tracking with the hero sensor is truly revolutionary. The software is user-friendly, and the aesthetics are pleasing. The RGB colors are vivid and vibrant.

I strongly recommend purchasing the Logitech Powerplay. It eliminates the need for charging the mouse and seamlessly integrates with your existing mousepad. It connects to the mousepad rather than the dongle, ensuring impeccable connectivity.

Ergonomically, it is exceptional!"
Anthony,,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2024","Used the OG G502 for well over 6 years and it has had little to no double-click issues (when it does it usually goes away almost immediately). This one feels a lot better and is a lot lighter, has a much more sleek design, and I only used 20% battery over 12 hours with the RGB on. Very responsive mouse as well. Hopefully no double-clicking in the near future."
Chris S,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2023","My previous mouse was a G502 Hero (wired), so my review will focus a lot on the differences along with general observations.

Design: This mouse is raised slightly higher than the Hero, giving it more of a hump and not as flat as the Hero. I find this beneficial and more comfortable. It is not as drastic a hump as the Logitech MX Master, making it low enough to accommodate different grip styles. A palm style might not find it as beneficial or may prefer the Hero if they like a flatter mouse.

Buttons: The extra buttons have been slightly moved and in a way that I find to be more accessible. The DPI shift button is not as in the way as it was before and can even be covered completely, so it becomes a non-factor. If you like the DPI button, the button can be flipped, making it more accessible. The left clicker is also slightly wider, but still on the narrower side compared to a lot of other mice.

The clicks are satisfying and although they require a bit more force than the Hero, they feel more responsive and less squishy. My primary reason for replacing my Hero was that the right button started double clicking, so I will update this review if the same issue occurs on these new switches that are supposed to avoid that problem developing.

Weight: The weight has been reduced considerably and the mouse does NOT contain a place for extra weights like the Hero does. If you like a heavier mouse, this may not be what you're looking for. That being said, I had weights in my Hero and have found the lighter weight decreases fatigue while also making it easier to move around; took some getting used to, but within a few hours of use I had adjusted and actually really like how much lighter it is.

Battery Life: At full charge the Logitech software estimates about 150 hours of battery life. So far, the estimate appears to be fairly accurate. Will update if any issues with battery life come up.

Scroll Wheel: The scroll wheel is much lighter and has a rubber coating. I always found the Hero to be just a little too heavy, but I feel like they could have made the new wheel slightly heavier. That being said, it has definable notches in the locked/line position and spins just as fast in the unlocked/free spin position.

Miscellaneous: The rubber coating is different and while I've seen some say it is better, I would just say it is different. Not better or worse. The sensor is essentially the same as the Hero and performs just as well.
The cutouts where the lights go for the Pro version are surprisingly not noticed when using. I was afraid they would cut into my hand, but they somehow figured out a good angle and size for them that I don't notice them.

Overall, the mouse is an improvement in many respects over the hero."
Joseph L.,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024","I replaced my ""ol' reliable"" Logitech G502 Hero after several years of use due to the infamous double clicking issue. I'm not a tinkerer, so I figured to make an upgrade. Just like it's predecessor, this one is certainly living up to the G502 reliability, affordability, and quality. It's reasonable priced for an upgrade. I never thought I'd invest in a wireless gaming mouse, but this one has certainly defied my expectations. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have opted for it, but the wired one had no RGB and I RGB vomit everything, so I returned it lol. Well played Logitech 😑 The RGB is very easy to set up and had a lot of options for customizing. The battery life lasts for several days at a time with it always being on w/ RGB and likely longer if I turned it off after each use. If you're tied to the cord, you can simply plug it in when gaming and unplug for everything else. If the charging pad was an option as a full desk-mat, I would have opted for it, but I don't want to put it on top of my current Razer RGB desk-mat. It feels a little less robust in comparison to the G502 Hero in terms of weight (likely due to the absence of a battery and optional weights) and external materials. I did miss the metal scroll wheel, braided wire (this one is rubber, but I'm rarely using it anyways) and the option for weights, but I've long forgotten them after a couple of months of use. It is fairly light though, if that's a big deterrent for you. Otherwise, if you are looking to wireless upgrade, I couldn't recommend this one enough! If you'd prefer wired and don't care for RGB, get the other one for less and same specs. There's a reason why this mouse is sitting pretty with thousands of reviews and an average of 4.5 stars at the time of this review. GET IT! G502 MASTER RACE!!"
Spencer L.,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024","I have used the G502 hero for about 3 years now, however mine developed issues with missed clicks and the sensor that are quite common with the old model. The G502 X, to me, is a meaningful improvement over the prior model. Not only are the sensor and buttons much less prone to issues, the mouse is significantly lighter and the model without RGB will run for ~120 hours on a charge. If you are in the market for a 502 hero replacement or looking for a mouse with this particular style of ergonomics you can’t go wrong here."
Dylan B.,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2024","I'm coming from the G502 Proteus Spectrum, I actually had two. Very similar buildwise, but I find this wireless version of the G502 lineup to be absolutely amazing. It has a long lasting battery life, the buttons feel great to click, and the scroll wheel feels much nicer to scroll with compared to the metal one that would wear down on the Proteus Spectrum after a few years of use. I'm also a big fan of the RGB / customization you can do with this, it has a great design / aesthetic to it.

I was worried about the connectivity of it being wireless, but so far I haven't noticed any major difference between my old wired mouse. You can always plug it in wired as well, if that's a concern.

Previously I tried out the G502 Hero a few years ago, and I hated it - it was too small for my hand. Especially the thumbrest part. But this mouse is perfect in every single way. The clicks aren't silent either - about as loud as the Proteus Spectrum - if that's something that bothers you.

I'm also someone who uses a mix of the fingertip/palm grip, basically where I'm almost fully gripping the mouse, but my palm isn't touching it."
M.Lee Fox,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024","I've been using this mouse for some time now and it has always been amazing. The biggest down side to Logitech mice are the double clicking issues and the scroll wheel issue. Hopefully, with the new laser sensor for the mouse button, we don't ever have to worry about the clicking issue.

The only down side for this mouse it the overall weight of over 106g. This mouse would be absolutely amazing if Logitech could somehow shave an additional 15g off the weight of the mouse..."

Joseph R. Granto,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2024","My old starting going bad after 4 years (mouse clicks became intermittent). The G502 X Plus Lightspeed is the modern replacement. It is essentially the same as my old Lightspeed except with a slightly better sensor, lighter (and no add-on weights), and more RGB.

I love the design and ergonomics of the G502 series, so I love this mouse. With the exception of being lighter, it feels the same (which is a good thing). It still requires the G Hub software for programming, which I HATE. G Hub is seriously horrible. But the mouse is worth it.

Be advised that, due to the suckiness of G Hub, any profiles you have with a different mouse have to be manually recreated with a new mouse. This was confirmed by Logitech support and is due to each device being assigned a unique ID, and the profiles are device-specific. Thus, if you upgrade your mouse, or if your upgrade your computer, you had better document your profile settings so that you can recreate them. This is not a mouse problem - the problem is that G Hub is horrible."

Shopper,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 29, 2024","I needed a powerplay compatible mouse and decided on this one. The LED lights, though superfluous and an added cost, are pleasant to look at and have smooth gradient effects. The battery stays > 80% when using the powerplay mat without enabling any energy-saving features.

There are a couple issues I've come across:

1. If you don't use the onboard memory, when the mouse wakes up it will momentarily use default settings which is most noticeable with the DPI -- the mouse will start moving slowly then when it loads your settings it sets your desired DPI which causes a jump in sensitivity. It's jarring, and if you're moving a window when it occurs it let's go of the window when the switch occurs.

2. If you use the onboard memory to avoid issue #1, the RGB lighting is sort of unpredictable. Sometimes it will work as expected, but other times it won't turn on at all. And sometimes it will use some random lighting colors that you don't define in G Hub."
Magman,,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2022","I've been using the g502 mouse since they first release and I love how they feel because I have large hands.
The issue I had with the old mice was the left button would always go bad on me I've went through four of them so far and it seemed to last me I'm about a year or so before issues arise.
Come to find out it was a very common issue with the types of switches they were using so they wouldn't hold the click even though you were holding the button down.
The new g502x uses an optical switch and I was concerned with how good it would feel because I've seen a couple reviewers talk about how travel there was in the left click button before it would actually actuate but either they fixed that issue before they released them to the public or I got lucky and got a good one or it's possible that it's just not as bad as the reviewers saying it had too much travel.
Compared to my g502 hero it is a lot lighter and the Virgin PTFE pads really make a difference that so much smoother across my mouse pad.
Back to what I was talking about before the optical switches feel great to me they feel like a very positive click and it's very fast to actuate.
The general shape is great since I'm already used to the g502 because there was no adjustment. To get used to this mouse like there is sometimes when you switch from one brand to another because physically it's almost the same as far as the in hand field goes.

They went with a lighter scroll wheel which I thought would be an issue whenever I would use the free Spin feature by unlocking the scroll wheel because of less rotating Mass however I can give the wheel a good flick and it spins like crazy so I'm very happy with it.
The scroll wheel also has a more tactile feel when switching between weapons and games or whatever you might use your scroll wheel for in your game feels like it is a little more firm than my old mouse but that could just be the fact of the old mouse was born in but it is by no means hard to turn in fact due to the new design actually find it easier to grip and spin with my fingers.

My overall impressions of this mouth so far are that I think I'm going to love it it definitely seems like a winner in my book."

Dale Dufford,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2023","I have tried many mice throughout the years from many different brands and with many different grip styles, but I always find myself coming back to the G502. I've had several of them over the years, but this one is by far my favorite.

PROS:
-The design of the mouse is great (in my opinion)
-Premium build quality.
-It fits my hand perfectly and is extremely comfortable for long-term use.
-It glides across my desk with ease.
-Logitech's Lightspeed Wireless technology is great. I've never experienced a moment of lag or had the mouse disconnect.
-The ""infinite-scroll"" scroll wheel is awesome to have on this mouse, especially as a frequent MX Master user.
-The buttons feel great and work consistently.
-The battery lasts me for weeks with consistent heavy usage (with LEDs off)
-USB-C Charging

CONS:
-Expensive. Like, really expensive. There are plenty of other mice that absolutely destroy this mouse in price-to-performance.
-Poor battery life with LEDs on. One of the main reasons I switched to this mouse from the Razer Viper Ultimate I was using was the poor battery life of the Viper (with LEDs on). The G502 definitely outperforms the Viper in terms of battery life (With LEDs on), but still will only last me a few days with heavy usage. I've since turned the LEDs off and have had incredible battery life.
-Heavy. This is by no means a lightweight mouse. It comes with extra optional weights that you can add to the mouse, but they make an already heavy mouse even heavier. I personally don't love super lightweight mice, and the G502 without the weights is about the perfect weight for me. However, I know many people prefer lightweight mice over heavy ones.

Overall, this is a fantastic mouse, and I expect to continue to use it for years to come. This is a big step up in quality from their G502 Hero mouse. I have used several of them in the past, and they've always just felt cheap to me. This mouse feels premium but also has a premium price tag."
Dave Piston,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024","Pros:
1) Distinct metallicy click sound when using main mouse buttons (love it or hate it, I love it)
2) Cool looking design and colors
3) Buttons feel good to use and have good response times
4) Mouse is light and easy to maneuver when using
5) Good selection of buttons
6) App is easy to use

Cons:
1) The mouse is rather long so those with smaller hands or those that prefer a smaller mouse should look elsewhere. It took some getting used to and I still wish it was about half an inch smaller for better button access.
2) The cord can be annoying but that was the tradeoff with the price so it balances. Know what you're getting into. No batteries and great respone time but you're physically tethered.
3) As far as I know you can't reprogram the DPI adjustment buttons on the top to the left of the main mouse button. I rarely need to adjust DPI on the fly and would rather program them for specific games but I don't think that's an option.

Summary:
Overall good design and performance. You sacrifice freedom of movement with the cord but I think the value and the lack of batteries and bluetooth hassle are worth it."
Shira,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024","Geared up for a late-night raid with my squad, I snagged my new Logitech mouse (not gonna lie, the name's a mouthful, but I'll stick with ""Speedy"") and dove in. This little beast was a game-changer. My usual wired mouse always tangled in the heat of the moment, yanking me out of the zone at the worst times. Speedy's wireless freedom was pure magic. No more cord bungee acrobatics, just smooth, precise tracking as I mowed down enemies.
Speaking of precision, Speedy's sensor is like a freakin' laser. Headshots I used to dream about were landing with sickening regularity. And the clicks? Oh, the clicks. Satisfyingly snappy without feeling mushy – they felt like an extension of my own reflexes. Plus, the programmable buttons let me map my grenades and abilities right where my fingers naturally rested. No more fumbling for keys in the heat of battle.
Overall, Speedy's become my trusty wingman. Whether I'm dominating in FPS games or just trying to conquer spreadsheets, it's been a total upgrade. If you're looking for a wireless mouse that's as quick as it is comfy, do yourself a favor and grab one. You won't regret it."

Alex Chulzhanov,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2023","I was a bit hesitant on the price for this mouse but ordered one to replace my well worn MX Master 3S. Overall the mouse is very high quality, responsive and accurate with great features both for gaming and for productivity.

Pros:
- PTFE sliders
- Excellent ergonomics and material choices, improved over the G502 Hero
- Highly accurate and good feedback in the buttons and scrolling
- Hyperscrolling button for going through spreadsheets or email inboxes very quickly
- Good weight (this one is subjective, but I like a heavier mouse. Even being wireless this one is pretty lightweight but enough mass to have a nice feel)

Cons:
- Lightspeed only. Lightspeed is really cool, and makes the mouse extremely accurate, but not having the convenience of Bluetooth is definitely a minus in my book, especially having to switch the dongle between devices instead of just pressing a button on the bottom of the mouse like with the MX Master.

Aside from the dongle limitations, the mouse itself is well worth it. The RGB lighting is very nice and Logitech’s G Hub software is pretty good. Battery life has also been very good. I am interested to try it out with the PowerPlay mouse pad eventually, as this mouse is compatible."

S. Hall,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023","EDIT October 1st 2023:
I have to make an update to this because Ive found something that has become and issue for me with this mouse. Because of the way the mouse is shaped and how I hold it, I have noticed that I am pushing on the front of the mouse with my fingertips and lifting the mouse up on the back end at times which makes the sensor not work properly. I had never noticed this prior but its become an issue at times during heated gameplay sessions. Because the mouse buttons hang so far over the edge of the mouse body and because I have larger hands and tend to be a bit heavy handed when using the mouse, it pushed down on the front lifting the back of the mouse and moving the sensor away from my mousepad thus making it stop working at times. This is something Im going to have to adjust in terms of how I use and hold the mouse and can be overcome I think, but its something I will be more aware of moving forward when looking at buying a new mouse to replace this one eventually. If you have larger hands and tend to be a bit more aggressive, this might also be an issue for you so be aware of that prior to purchase.

Ive used the G502 series mice for years now starting with the original wired version then moving to the wireless. Love both of them and this wasnt a need as much as it was a want purchase and its great.

The only thing I dont like it about it is the sound the new switches make. I know its a silly quibble, but the clanky sound on the primary left and right mouse buttons is clanky whereas the previous 502 wireless has a softer click to it. Maybe it just needs to break in a bit and it will go away but other than that its great."

Amazon Customer,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2023","I had a G502 HERO, but wound up hating it due to the awful, slippery, ultra heavy mouse wheel and overall weight. This fixes these problems, and it is now my favorite mouse. It is much lighter overall, and while the wheel is still a bit heavier than I'd like, it requires much less force to scroll in click mode, and has less momentum in free scrolling mode than the HERO. It also has a nice texture rubber surface, instead of the HERO's awful smooth metallish texture.

The (separate) wireless charging system also works very well, and pretty much solves the last remaining issue with a wireless mouse.

I don't remember if this was a feature of the older versions, but this lets you remove that awful ""Shift"" thumb button, that was always in the way for general use, but still too far from my thumb to reach conveniently. You can now shift it closer, or remove it altogether, which is great.

The only major downside is that Logitech's software has unfortunately been overwhelmed with bloat, which used to be one of their major advantages back when LGS (or even SetPoint) was a thing, and this mouse isn't supported by LGS at all. Fortunately they now provide a tool which lets you edit the memory profiles stored on the mouse itself without installing that awful heap of bloatware G HUB or whatever it is called now. It is somewhat limited, particularly as it doesn't support macros but it is enough for most uses, and autohotkey fills in the gaps."

Liz,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2023","We are going on a ""replace peripherals with USB C versions"" around the house, and it was mouse time. I figured a Lightspeed version of my favorite G502 would be a straight swap just with USB C. I've been pleasantly surprised (and one aspect I was convinced I wouldn't, but turned out fine). First, the traction pads have a nice upgrade that makes the mouse float over a mousepad, friction is really perfect. The hybrid clicks on the primary and secondary buttons feel really good, good haptic feedback but not overkill like a mechanical keyboard (different strokes for different folks). I was VERY worried when I got the mouse and noticed an oversight on my part: the X lightspeed version doesn't come with weights, one of my favorite features of the older non X version. After a few days, I can confidently say I've forgotten all about the weights. The X version is SIGNIFICANTLY lighter but very well balanced, I don't find my self wanting for the weights, action on this mouse is really consistent. Got this on Black Friday sale, old mouse gets the rotation to wife's work machine (she loves it) and everybody's happy."

The software is not great and lacking features that is used by many other mouse brands. The one thing with the software that I am disappointed that is missing is there isn't an option for angle snapping which I like to use when doing CAD work. That is the only thing that is keeping this from a 5 star review.

One of the things that I have found the most useful that I didnt expect was the free scrolling mouse wheel when the button is clicked off. Such a breeze navigating websites and other programs to get through menus and etc.

Gaming with this is nice and the mechanical switches feel very good when using the buttons on the mouse. My only grip is the software lacking in features. But with that said I would buy this again if I am ever looking for another mouse."
Michael,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","If you're a fan of the original g502, this is a great upgrade. Though, nothing wrong with the original.

With those who do upgrade, expect a similar shape albeit slightly different but nonetheless fits your hand perfectly. I find this mouse to be exemplary for those looking for one mouse to get the job done. This isn't your lightweight fps mouse, but if weight is of no obligation to you, this mouse at 106g is nimble enough for most.

What's nice is for you star wars lovers including myself is that you can get this Millennium Falcon version at no upcharge versus the plain black or white. The printing is immaculate and the colored plastics are fantastic and compliment the art design as well.

I also feel as this came specific mouse came out almost a year after the original that internal tweaks were performed by Logitech to improve mouse quality. Prior copies have had a very metallic sound to the click with them being hybrid optical switches. I find this batch to have increase quality click and doesn't have the harsh feed back and jarring bottom out feeling when using the mouse.

Overall, I am highly impressed with this mouse. And the fact that this mouse feels better the the original batch and themed as the Millennium Falcon at the same price as the other model makes this a no brainer for those Star Wars fans or those going with a Star Wars aesthetic."
Aaron Franke,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2023","I had a minor amount of connection issues with the wireless dongle, where it cuts out for a small fraction of a second many times per hour. I was planning on using wired anyway but I wanted to have the option of wireless available so I gave it a shot, I was a bit disappointed. However it may have been an issue with my setup (hardware, OS, drivers, interference, etc) or a one-off issue, it'll work well enough for situations where I don't need perfect reliability (like controlling an HTPC), and it works perfectly in wired mode, so I'm still going to round up to 5 stars.

The scroll wheel feels a bit too stiff in the fixed step mode, and way too loose in the free mode, for my personal taste. I ended up using the fixed step mode and just adjusting to the stiffness.

The mouse is configured in software, but the configuration can be saved to the hardware, and multiple profiles can be installed and toggled with a button on the mouse. This is great, because I can configure it once and then never touch the software again.

The selection of buttons on the mouse is perfect. Not a massive keypad like some mice, but still plenty of good buttons. Each is unique, easy to find by touch, feels great to press, and are in non-intrusive locations (like the scroll wheel side clicking, or the buttons to the left of the left click)."

Void_Sentient,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2024","With RGB off, the battery lasts about a month from experience, over the 3 with a weak AA the Basilisk X I used to use had. The rubber is starting to wear a tiny bit after 4 months. Every other experience has been pretty stellar, if the software is a little confusing. However, your pc isn't taken hostage if you don't install the software unlike Razer who manages to slip in yelling at you every windows update with a reminder they still have you by your Core 2 Duos with their incessant advertising. Logitech G Hub is a fairly pleasant software to use in comparison. The switches feel good and there is no perceivable latency. The free spin for the scroll wheel is really smooth and satisfying to flick around, and though I don't use it the sniper button is pretty neat. The scroll wheel is also rebindable if you want to be a bit cheeky in modded Minecraft without using a macro."
Steven Precourt,,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2023","My review is for the Gen 2 mouse. I have used the Gen 1 for almost 10 years as my primary mouse, and while it was great in most ways, it had some flaws like the defective switches which eventually made the mouse unusable, and also the excessive weight. The Gen 2 keeps everything that was good about the Gen 1 and improves everything that was wrong. The new switches feel great and super responsive, and because they're optical, there's no risk anymore of unwanted double clicking or getting stuck down. The weight of the mouse has also been reduced so it makes your response time and fatigue lower. I think the grip pads on the sides are more comfortable than the old model. I have big hands so using a ""normal"" size mouse is painful for me and the Gen 1 and Gen 2 are the only mice I've used that fit well in my hand. I can put my whole hand on the mouse up to my palm and my hand doesn't overhang the mouse. The Logitech software is also great and easy to use and lets you manually set DPI and rebind every button on the mouse which is amazing. So in summary, I think the Gen 2 is the best gaming mouse available."

Thomas,,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024","I've had this mouse for a few months now and find it very good quality.

The battery lasts quite a long time, I recharge it infrequently and I have the impression that it recharges quickly, I've never yet run out of battery while using it.
I also don't think there's anything to worry about in terms of mouse latency, it's imperceptible in my experience, I don't know, maybe more experienced gamers will see some latency but I don't think so.
I also use it for editing, and the shortcuts are useful.

Two bits of advice: disabling the backlight saves a lot of battery life (it may be better to buy the non-LED version) and I recommend buying a protective cover if you take the mouse on the move."
Francisco,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2023","Bought this as an upgrade from my wired G502 (Proteus spectrum-2016). That old mouse still worked perfectly (after 7 years of punishment) but it looked very worn out so I went for this new wireless version. This new mouse exceeded my expectations. The weight difference is MASSIVE. Before the change I used to get wrist pain after playing for a few hours, I even thought I had carpal tunnel syndrome (chronic wrist pain). Nevertheless after the change to the new mouse the pain is totally gone, I guess the lower weight is the reason.

I also like the new design. It is sleeker and most importantly it catches considerably less dirt than the old one. The way the buttons click and feel is also very sweet, I even like it more than the old version. At the beginning I was a little doubtful about getting a wireless mouse, since I thought that charging it would be annoying. I was wrong though, the battery lasts around 5 weeks (Using my PC 5 hours a day on average) and it charges relatively quickly, so the benefit of enjoying wireless freedom far outweights the need to charge it once in a while.

The logitech app to configure the mouse is not the best in the market, but for me it works fine. I really don't care about the lack of RGB and if it had RGB I would have it off anyways since it drains the battery extreamly quickly."
zunami,,"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024","I'm glad they reverted to this ergonomic shape - This same type was popular in the 2010s, and I held on to an old one for years after they kind of fell off."
PietroMoopy,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2023","I've been using the G502 since it came out pretty much. I have a wired Hero currently and have been through about 5 different mice because of button failures. However, the Hero version has never failed on me. I wanted to get a wireless mouse, so I bought this. I personally think it's a step backwards. The DPI UP/DOWN buttons are better, but the scroll wheel is a step back in my opinion. There is no weight to it and when you want it to roll without resistance it's much harder to get going because it feels flimsy. Also, that is the main issue with this mouse for me, its weight the thing is way to light and there is no way to add weight to it. It makes the thing feel flimsy and this for a premium? What were they thinking, I will probably just order the wireless Hero version and return this mouse. I do like the DPI button change, but for me that is the only plus that this mouse brings to the table.

Edit: After a few days with the mouse it's actually quite good. I guess I was just so used to the other one in which I put a few weights in. But the X is starting to grow on me."
Jon Snow,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023","Let's face it... It's hard to find a good mouse to fit larger hands. I never realized how important the location of where the middle of my ring finger contacts the mouse was prior to seeking my ideal wireless mouse. I have larger hands (20.5 cm or 8"" base of palm to tip of middle finger). I use hybrid claw/fingertip-ish grip with the back of my palm on the desk about 2 inches away from the very back of the mouse and no part of the palm touching the mouse. After trying and returning things like a Steelseries Prime Wireless, Steelseries Rival 650 wireless and Corsair Ironclaw Wireless, I found the size of the mouse does not necessary equate to comfort so much as design and contours. I love the switches/clicks of the Steelseries Prime mouse and the size and contours of the Ironclaw. The switches on the Ironclaw wireless were not as good as the switches on the wired Ironclaw I own and love. The Logitech G502 X wireless mouse is a great combination of the size/contours of the Ironclaw and the crisp-switch feel of the Steelseries. The Steelseries mice were extremely uncomfortable and even though they spec on the larger side, I felt like I had to pinch the mouse in order for my fingers to make contact with both sides causing cramping within minutes. The Ironclaw wireless switches I would consider near-faulty in design; complete mush. The G502 X feels like it's wired whereas the other wireless mice I tried did not feel as responsive (all using the included 2.4Ghz dongles). The G502 X wireless is now my go-to mouse. The G-hub software is Ok, but I think the Steelseries GG and Corsair software are more intuitive."
Joel P.,,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024","I've been using the old, wired version of this mouse for about 3 years now. After switching, I cannot imagine ever going back. the lack of needed cables, and the more space I was able to free u pfrom removing my cable hanger, has givven me so much free raign on my desk it's insane. I expected latency because of the wireless system, but there was almost no difference I could see. Automatically took on my old mouse settings once I plugged it into logitech G Hub, and the onbard memory works perfectly.

10/10 would highly recommend."
John Grey,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2023","Bought this to replace my wired G502 (non-Hero) that I gifted to my kiddos. If you liked the G502 or its variants, then the G502X is more of the same with a slight visual flourish. This is also means what I disliked about the G502 carries over the G502X as well.

In my case, I primarily play strategy games, RPGs, and first-person shooters in a distant 3rd. Prior to any of the G502 variants, I owned a G602, which has 6 thumb buttons and a higher physical profile, i.e. the arch where the palm would rest upon. The G502X, like its G502 siblings, only have 3 thumb buttons and a slightly lower physical profile. This smaller profile forces my hand into a claw-like grip, which leads to cramping after prolonged gaming sessions. My adult sized hand is a little over 7.5"" inches from the base of my palm to tip of my middle finger and about 9"" from the tip of my pinky to thumb when I spread my fingers as wide apart as I can go without stretching. The ergonomics were a non-issue with the G602, which fit my hand a bit more comfortably, because of the high palm arch. So why don't I go back to the G602? Well, I prefer the thumb button layout of the G502X and - to a much lesser extent - its visual flare. It's just much easier for my smooth brain to discern which thumb button I'm pressing without looking down and/or hunting for it like the G602/604. Ideally, I'd have a G504X, or something like that where it has the palm arch of the G602/604 variants, but the button layout of the G502X.

My last minor gripe about this mouse is that the RGB strip they contoured into the palm can be a little distracting because it's a harsh sudden line across the plastic. It would be nice if it was beveled/rounded a bit more so it would be so noticeable on the palm. It's a minor complaint as it takes some getting used to. Overall, I recommend this mouse.. it's still the best compromise of ergo, features, and flair that I could find."
Erik R. Johnson,,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2023","First some basics. The primary button clicks do have a different sound/feel. It sounds almost metallic. What matters most is performance, and it sounds like the old switches could have problems where double-clicks are accidentally triggered (as the switches age -- relaying info, my prior mouse was Corsair). The scroll wheel is incredible in free-flow mode. I changed OS scrolling rate to one line per wheel step, and that combined with flick spinning is so incredibly useful!

I was going to with non-RGB because LED lights are really just a look thing so not important and it would eat into battery time significantly. But then I saw that the Logitech G Powerplay mouse pad both charges the mouse + serves as the wireless relay so you can use the wireless dongle elsewhere (like a laptop). Now, with the charging pad, battery is not an issue. The battery stays charged in the 85% to 95% range which is better than trying to keep it 100% (for battery longevity). So, the mouse is always ready to be used away from the pad if need be.

Right now this mouse is nearly ideal. Yes, it is expensive, but currently I consider it worth it. Even though I'm not into flash computer hardware, switching the LEDs to cycle through the spectrum over 20 seconds is really pretty neat looking. I have LED power default to 50% (because full is not needed), and switch to 25% when idle. This makes the mouse easier to see on the pad (otherwise completely black mouse on a black pad). Sure this is a minor thing, but hey, still neat."
David romero,,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",great response times
E Miller,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024","Incredibly impressed. I have multiple apps that I use daily, and this mouse is able to adjust the hotkeys based on what app I'm using. I'm so much faster now. The software is clean and easy to use.

The scroll wheel is ""loose"", which means you can spin it like a skateboard-wheel and it'll keep spinning. This can be very handy. When I have lots of scrolling to do, I just give it a whirl.

When it comes to clicking the middle mouse (scroll wheel down), that's a bit of an adjustment when you're used to regular mice (since it's so sensitive it may scroll before you click). But I got used to it pretty quickly.

I also love how it looks. I got the white ""stormtrooper"" looking one."
Fernando Salazar,,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2024","I have not turned off the mouse a single time, I dont know the specifics but looks like it is quite amazing for managing stand by.
About 10-12 hours of daily use and battery still going strong after 3 weeks, as I'm typing this. Logitech software states 160hours of battery, which I tought it was a complet LIE, but it actually isn't, cheers to them for that, I think it is parcially thanks to not having RGB on the mouse to waste battery.

It has basically 0 delay, it is even better than my previous WIRED g502 hero mouse, while being wireless.
For gaming, I use a claw grip on FPS games, it is supper comfy, and grippy. Full grip it also feels super natural.

TLDR; AMAZING battery and no delay at all. Just what I needed."
R. Benham,,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2023","Haven't played pc in years and have been sitting on a high end PC for a year. The mouse it came with was atrocious and you could notice the low dpi, only moving pixel by pixel.

Growing up I've always steered towards logitech mice, I've tried many others, razor included but nothing compared to the ergonomic design of logitech mice.

This one is no different, it's lightweight and smooth as butter. Has more than enough programmable buttons all around your thumb for easy access. This mouse compared to the horrid ibuypower rgb one my pc came with is night and day.

My only issue is I always liked the mice with interchangeable weights that allow you to modify the weight of the mouse that suits your playstyle, while this is comfortable that's my only caviet.

The one I received had a kink in the cable close to where the hard wire meets the mouse which isn't causing an issue NOW but down the road may.

If you want a extremely precise, smooth and lightweight mouse for gaming, look no further. If you're like me and prefer an adjustable weighted mouse, maybe shop around.

All and all this mouse is extremely comfortable to use for extended periods of time. The ergonomics are on point and reduce wrist strain."

vespafive,,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022","Pros:
-New grips are actually improvement over the original
-Optical hybrid switches remedy the notorious double clicking issue that Logi mice tend to have
-Hero sensor is accurate
-Great PTFE feet
-The wired version is 89 grams and it feels way lighter than the OG G502
-The comfort in holding this thing with the balanced weight make for amazing control

Cons:
-The wired version comes with a FLIMSY rubber cable. I don't mind the cable being on a mouse bungee but it's so thin, I really don't know how well this cable will withstand the wear and tear. The cable is this mouse's Achilles Heel. Not because it's rubber, but because it's the flimsiest cable I've ever seen on a gaming mouse (especially for a mouse that's $79.99)
-For a wired mouse, this is not a very long mouse cable.
-Great for all genres of gaming, but 89 grams is still pretty heavy for games that require quick reaction time (at least for me).

Overall: It's a great mouse. I didn't like the OG G502 because it was so friggin' heavy (even without the weights). I could've opted for the wireless version but I wanted the lightest version of this mouse possible. So I got the wired version. My only concern is that this mouse cable is so flimsy that I don't know if it's going to endure the wear and tear. For now, I've got a mouse bungee to compensate for the cable dragging on the mouse pad.

Update 1: I returned the wired version and got a wireless version. It's 10 grams heavier but it's very difficult to tell.

Update 2: I re-purchased my 2nd copy (wired). So the wireless version is for productivity and the 89 gram wired one is for gaming. Although, for FPS games, I can only use this for specific classes (sniping or campy like classes)."

juan p.,,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2023","i will list the cons and pros about the mouse:

PROS
-this mouse is that it does not include RGB son you will save that battery that you might rather want
-VERY good looking
-very precise sensor
-lightweight
-amount of buttons that you can configure or even macro with the Logitech G-Hub
-VERY fast charge, with the included high quality usb-c cable (shame its not c to c but rather usb to type c)

Cons

- Button layout: i feel like this is the hardest thing to get used to, the buttons are easy to press by accident so you might end up giving accidental clicks all over the place.
- shape (although i love it i do know its not for everybody specially lefties)
-no RGB? if you are into that (im not specially on mouses because it demolishes battery duration)

overall definetly recomend this mouse, specially considering you will never suffer from double click that was the main problem for Logitech mouses."
